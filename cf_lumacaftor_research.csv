Effect of CFTR modulators on glucose homeostasis in children and young adults with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes: a systematic review.,"Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to impaired chloride transport, thickened mucus, and multiorgan dysfunction. Among its complications, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is a major concern, characterized by progressive b-cell dysfunction and insulin deficiency. The advent of CFTR modulators, including ivacaftor, lumacaftor/ivacaftor, and elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), has revolutionized CF management by improving pulmonary function, nutritional status, and overall survival. However, their effects on glucose metabolism remain under investigation.Methods: This systematic review (systematic review registration: PROSPERO 2025 CRD420251021499) analyzes recent evidence on the impact of CFTR modulators on CFRD in children and young adults. Results: Ivacaftor demonstrates potential benefits in glucose regulation, enhancing insulin secretion and glucagon control, particularly in patients with gating mutations. Conversely, lumacaftor/ivacaftor exhibits inconsistent effects, with some studies indicating glucose tolerance improvements while others report insulin sensitivity decline.Discussion: ETI therapy shows modest but generally positive effects on glycemic control, with reductions in HbA1c and fasting glucose, though without significant changes in insulin secretion. While CFTR modulators improve systemic health, their role in directly preventing or reversing CFRD remains unclear. Further longitudinal studies are needed to optimize therapeutic strategies and elucidate the long-term metabolic effects of CFTR modulation in CF patients.Systematic review registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier CRD420251021499.",40842499,PMC12364668,10.3389/fendo.2025.1623654,,2025,"Giordano P, Leonetti G, Granberg V, Casolino RMP, Lassandro G, Delvecchio M, Linguiti G.",Y,MED

Effects of CFTR Modulators on *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* Infections in Cystic Fibrosis.,"**Background**: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Modulator therapies have the ability to improve CFTR function in CF patients, but despite the clear evidence of benefits regarding CFTR modulator therapy, including improved lung function, the reduced rate of exacerbations, and an overall improved quality of life, studies focusing on the reduction rates of *P. aeruginosa* infections during modulator therapy expressed the need for future research on this topic. **Objective**: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of CFTR modulator therapies on the prevalence, density, and persistence of *P. aeruginosa* infection in CF patients and to explore the mechanisms involved. **Methods**: A systematic literature review was performed by searching five major databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science), and 21 relevant articles investigating the link between CFTR therapy and *P. aeruginosa* infections were selected following the PRISMA guidelines. **Results**: The data indicated that Ivacaftor and the combination Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI) can reduce total bacterial load and markers of systemic inflammation. However, clonal lines of *P. aeruginosa* persist in most cases, and complete eradication is rare, mainly due to biofilm formation and antimicrobial resistance. **Conclusions**: Although CFTR-modulating therapies help to improve clinical condition and reduce inflammation, they do not consistently lead to the elimination of *P. aeruginosa*.",40700326,PMC12285981,10.3390/idr17040080,,2025,"Pescaru CC, Crișan AF, Marițescu A, Cărunta V, Marc M, Dumitrache-Rujinski Ș, Laitin S, Oancea C.",Y,MED
Comparison of the Effect of CFTR Modulators *elexacaftor*/*tezacaftor*/*ivacaftor* and *lumacaftor*/*ivacaftor* via Serum Human Epididymis Protein 4 Concentration in *p.Phe508del-CFTR* Homozygous Cystic Fibrosis Patients.,"Elevated human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) levels decreased in patients with CF (pwCF) in response to CFTR-specific drugs and negatively correlated with FEV1% predicted values (ppFEV1). **Objectives:** Although *elexacaftor*/*tezacaftor*/*ivacaftor* (ETI, Kaftrio®) demonstrates more substantial effectiveness than *lumacaftor*/*ivacaftor* (LUM/IVA, Orkambi®) in pwCF, plasma biomarkers have not been used to compare treatment efficacy. Hence, our aim was to correlate the change in HE4 levels and the clinical effects of these CFTR modulators (CFTRm). **Methods:** Serum HE4 concentrations were measured in a total of 123 pwCF homozygous for the *p.Phe508del-CFTR* variant before treatment and 1-6 months after either ETI or LUM/IVA administration. A correlation between serum HE4 and ppFEV1 was assessed using the Spearman test. HE4 protein levels were also analyzed in the supernatants of *p.Phe508del-CFTR* CFBE 41o- cells before and after treatment with these CFTRm, and their direct effect on CFTR function was monitored by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. **Results:** Serum HE4 levels were reduced below baseline after 3 months of either ETI or LUM/IVA (mean delta HE4: -38.5 vs. -18.5 pmol/L, respectively) when the mean change of ppFEV1 was 13.6 vs. 1.6% and remained decreased up to 6 months. A significant inverse correlation between HE4 and ppFEV1 was observed in both study cohorts (r = -0.537 and r = -0.575, respectively; *p* < 0.0001). In agreement with ex vivo results, the effect on *p.Phe508del-CFTR* was more pronounced by ETI than LUM/IVA in CFBE cells, showing a larger improvement in *p.Phe508del-CFTR* function and reductions in HE4 levels at 24 h. **Conclusions:** Serum HE4 negatively correlates with lung function improvement and monitors better drug efficacy in pwCF under ETI than LUM/IVA.",40943949,PMC12429638,10.3390/jcm14176188,,2025,"Pócsi M, Fila L, Péterfia C, Halász A, Szanto TG, Mészáros B, Major J, Laki I, Szabó H, Panyi G, Balogh I, Amaral MD, Macek M, Nagy B.",Y,MED
Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Modulators in Cystic Fibrosis: A Review of Registry-Based Evidence.,"Fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators (CFTRms) have significantly improved outcomes in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Real-world evidence, particularly from national and international CF registries, is essential to assess their long-term effectiveness and safety. We reviewed published studies using registry data to evaluate the impact of CFTRms on clinical outcomes in individuals with CF. A narrative review of studies published between 2015 and 2025 was conducted, focusing on registry-based evaluations of ivacaftor, lumacaftor/ivacaftor, tezacaftor/ivacaftor, and elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor. Primary outcomes included lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, nutritional status, and survival. Fifty-seven registry-based studies confirmed the benefits of CFTRms across diverse CF populations. Ivacaftor has demonstrated sustained improvements in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), reduced exacerbations, and improved nutritional outcomes. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor have shown modest benefits, especially in homozygous F508del patients. The introduction of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor has led to unprecedented improvements in lung function and quality of life, along with a reduced need for lung transplantation. Methodological heterogeneity and incomplete data remain challenges. Registry data provide essential, complementary evidence to clinical trials and support the effectiveness of CFTRms in routine care. Continued efforts are needed to harmonize registry methodologies and outcome measures.",40507740,PMC12155698,10.3390/jcm14113978,,2025,"Salvatore D, Pepe A.",Y,MED
Impact of Modulator Therapy on the Chronic Colonization of Lower Respiratory Tract Pathogens in Children: Data From Cystic Fibrosis Registry of Turkey.,"Background: Modulators have revolutionized cystic fibrosis (CF) management, but their effects on respiratory pathogens remain unclear. This study evaluated changes in lower respiratory tract pathogen detection after modulator therapy in children with CF, registered in the Cystic Fibrosis Registry of Turkey.Method: This retrospective, multicenter cohort study included children receiving modulator therapy between 2020 and 2022. Chronic respiratory tract colonization rates before and after therapy were compared, along with inhaler treatments, oral steroid, azithromycin use, pulmonary function tests, and hospitalizations for pulmonary exacerbations. The cohort was stratified by age, modulator type, and lung disease severity. Changes in microbiologic data over a 1-year period were also analyzed for children not receiving modulator therapy.Results: A total of 101 children (mean age 9.95 ± 4.44 years) were included. Following modulator therapy, respiratory cultures of 57 (56.4%) were negative. Among 32 children with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) colonization, 14 (44%) showed negative respiratory cultures after receiving modulator therapy (p = 0.039). Conversion to culture-negative status was significant for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (p = 0.022) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (p = 0.034), with ETI therapy yielding the highest conversion rates. Inhaled antibiotic use for chronic respiratory pathogens decreased significantly (p = 0.039), and spirometry parameters improved (p < 0.001). Among 1232 children not receiving modulators, 180 (14.6%) had negative respiratory cultures when examined at 1-year interval. In the same group, intermittent/chronic P. aeruginosa colonization was negative in 58 cases, while 85 developed new growth, following modulator therapy, with positivity rates rising from 16.3% to 18.5% (p = 0.030). No significant changes in other pathogen detection were observed.Conclusion: Modulators, particularly ETI, reduced respiratory pathogen detection and improved lung function in children with CF.",40504038,PMC12161001,10.1002/ppul.71155,,2025,"Sunman B, Yalçın E, Erdal MA, Şen V, Başkan AK, Kılınç AA, Yazan H, Çakır E, Demir AD, Ünal G, Savaş S, Pekcan S, Korkmaz M, Canıtez Y, Öztürk GK, Gülen F, Arık E, Keskin Ö, Ersoy A, Köse M, Serbes M, Altıntaş DU, Başaran AE, Bingöl A, Hocoğlu Zİ, Aslan AT, Yuluğ DP, Özdemir A, Tabakçı SÖ, Tural DA, Harmancı K, Özsezen B, Çobanoğlu N, Tongal SN, Çaltepe G, Hangül M, Aydın ZGG, Kılıç M, Hızal M, Baş N, Özcan G, Eyüboğlu TŞ, Emiralioğlu N, Cinel G, Özçelik U, Doğru D.",Y,MED
Impact of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor on the small airways in cystic fibrosis.,"Objective: To evaluate the impact of the elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) combination on the small airways in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder that primarily affects the respiratory system, leading to progressive lung disease. In CF, the small airways play a critical role, contributing to chronic symptoms such as cough, sputum production, and dyspnea.Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective observational study of adults with CF treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA for 12 months. We compared the patients who were homozygous for the F508del mutation of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene with those who were heterozygous for that mutation, in terms of lung function outcomes (FEV1, FEF25-75%, and the RV/TLC ratio) and the extent of non-homogeneous ground-glass opacity. Among the patients within the cohort, the same parameters were evaluated separately in those who had advanced lung disease and in those who had previously undergone CFTR modulator therapy.Results: There was a significant post-treatment improvement in lung function, with a median increase of 0.42 L/s in the FEF25-75% (p < 0.001) and a 5% reduction in the mean RV/TLC ratio (p < 0.001). There was a trend toward a higher improvement the F508del homozygous patients. A significant reduction in non-homogeneous ground-glass opacity was observed in 79.5% of the patients. Among the patients with advanced lung disease, there were notable post-treatment improvements in all of the parameters assessed.Conclusions: Our results highlight the positive impact that ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment can have on small airway function in patients with CF, with potential benefits even for those with advanced lung disease. Further research is needed in order to evaluate the long-term effects of this treatment and its relationship with patient-reported outcomes.",40531731,PMC12401089,10.36416/1806-3756/e20240406,,2025,"Silva SC, Barroso A, Cunha M, Fragoso E, Azevedo P.",Y,MED

The effect of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor on liver stiffness in children with cystic fibrosis.,"Objectives: Cystic fibrosis hepato-biliary involvement (CFHBI) is a common comorbidity in patients with CF and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The effect of the new and highly potent CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapy, elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI), on CFHBI, is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of ETI on liver stiffness in children with CF, as measured using two-dimensional (2D) shear wave elastography (SWE).Methods: Twenty-one children with CF were included in this retrospective study at the CF centre, Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. Twelve children of our cohort had CFHBI; none had advanced CF liver disease. 2D SWE data from annual assessments, clinical data and liver enzymes were analysed.Results: We found a significant reduction in liver stiffness after starting treatment with ETI in the total cohort. This reduction in liver stiffness could even be seen in children with CFHBI. Liver enzymes were within the normal range in both pre- and post-ETI therapy in the total cohort. In children with CFHBI, a decline in aspartate aminotransferase activity was observed after ETI was initiated. Lung function and lung clearance index improved significantly after ETI treatment commenced.Conclusion: ETI treatment could positively affect CFHBI in children with CF, as demonstrated by reduced liver stiffness during treatment.",40264362,PMC12210794,10.1002/jpn3.70050,,2025,"Diemer S, Elidottir H, Eklund EA, Påhlman LI, Hansen C.",Y,MED
Hemoglobin Levels in Children Treated for Cystic Fibrosis with CFTR Modulators: A Single Center Retrospective Study.,"**Background:** An increase in hemoglobin (Hb) has been reported in subjects with CF treated with the CFTR modulator Ivacaftor and with the combination Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor (LI), while the literature about the impact of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI) on Hb levels in the pediatric population is lacking. **Materials and Methods:** We retrospectively evaluated Hb levels in 35 subjects with CF (18 males, median age: 8 years; interquartile range (IQR): 6-13 years) treated with LI and 60 (24 males, median age: 10 years; IQR: 6-14 years) treated with ETI. For each subject we considered the values of Hb, serum potassium, total bilirubin (TB), and conjugated bilirubin (CB) at baseline, after 3 days, and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months from the start of treatment. **Results:** In subjects with CF treated with LI, we observed a significant increase in Hb values 3 days after the introduction of the drug, which remained constant throughout the year of treatment. In subjects treated with ETI, a significant decrease in Hb was observed 3 days after the first dose up to 1 month. At 6 months, Hb returned to pre-treatment values remaining stable for up to 12 months. At 3 days of treatment, we also observed a significant increase in serum potassium, which returned to normal at one month, while both TB and CB values significantly increased at 3 days of treatment and remained significantly higher for the whole one-year period of ETI therapy. **Conclusions:** We confirmed an increase in Hb values over time in subjects treated with LI. While the Hb response in those treated with ETI showed a transient reduction that lasted for one month, this may have depended on hemolysis, and returned to pre-treatment levels. Further studies will clarify the mechanisms that govern changes in Hb in subjects with CF treated with ETI.",40725549,PMC12295714,10.3390/jcm14144856,,2025,"Tosco A, Cerchione R, Gelzo M, Cimbalo C, Castaldo A, Terracciano R, Raia V, Sepe A.",Y,MED
Evolving nutrition therapy in cystic fibrosis: Adapting to the CFTR modulator era.,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR)-directed therapies, such as modulators, have transformed the medical management of people with CF, resulting in better lung function, weight, and body mass index in recent years. With improved nutrition status in people on CFTR modulators, the emphasis on a high-energy, high-fat diet (the legacy CF diet) is declining, with an increased focus on a healthy diet. The increased survival and median predicted age of people with CF have created a need for more attention to metabolic diseases, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases. The effects of modulators on extrapulmonary manifestations associated with CF, such as CF-related diabetes, CF hepatobiliary involvement, gastrointestinal tract disorders, and pancreatic manifestations, are currently unknown. Approximately 95% of people with CF qualify for treatment with a CFTR modulator. This review discusses the basics of CFTR gene mutations and changes in nutrition status related to treatment with CFTR modulators.",40533897,PMC12242106,10.1002/ncp.11332,,2025,"Vavrina K, Griffin TB, Jones AM, Schindler T, Bui TN, Sankararaman S.",Y,MED
Body composition changes and clinical outcomes in pediatric cystic fibrosis during 24 months of lumacaftor ivacaftor therapy based on real-world data.,"Clinical trials demonstrate the short-term efficacy of dual CFTR modulators, but long-term real-world data is limited. We aimed to investigate the effects of 24-month lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) therapy in pediatric CF patients (pwCF). This observational study included pwCF homozygous for F508del mutation treated between 2021 and 2023. We report data for the first 24 months from therapy initiation. Variables were analyzed separately for ages 2-5, 6-11, and over 12. Data from 49 pwCF (median age: 9.3 years (5.5-14.2)) showed that ppFEV1 values after a transient increase at 12 months, decreased from 102% (82-114) at baseline to 87% (74-96) at 24 months. The decrease was more pronounced with higher initial ppFEV1. Median sweat chloride concentration decreased from 75 mmol/L (69-82) to 57 mmol/L (43-70) without any association with respiratory function change. Median BMI z-score increased from - 0.81 (- 1.37-0.49) to - 0.39 (- 0.88 to - 0.04) (p = 0.288), and the proportion of underweight and overweight children decreased. Skeletal muscle mass remained stable, while fat mass significantly increased (p = 0.011). Fecal elastase levels improved, especially among younger patients. These findings underscore the potential benefits of early initiation of CFTR modulator therapy in pediatric CF patients, highlighting improvements in nutritional status and pancreatic function.",39824960,PMC11748628,10.1038/s41598-025-86010-1,,2025,"Imrei M, Kéri AF, Gács É, Gönczi I, Meláth M, Kosaras É, Demeter B, Péterfia C, Vass K, Székely G, Ocskay K, Párniczky A.",Y,MED
Improvement of iron status with elexacaftor tezacaftor ivacaftor therapy is associated with the correction of systemic inflammation and improvement of lung function: a one-year prospective study.,"Iron deficiency (ID) is frequent in adult patients with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). The effect of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) on iron metabolism has rarely been reported. We aimed to study the trends and variables associated with iron store modulation under ETI. We conducted a prospective adult cohort in two referral centres for pwCF. Iron supplementation during the follow-up was an exclusion criterion. Clinical, biological data and pulmonary function tests were collected prospectively at ETI initiation (V0) and after 1 year of ETI (V12). The presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in forced sputum was assessed at V0 and V12. 220 (87 women) pwCF among the 278 screened were included. At V0, ID prevalence was 58% and was significantly associated with female sex and lower forced expiratory volume (FEV1). At V12, ID prevalence decreased significantly from 58 to 31% (p = 0.001). A significant decrease of C reactive protein and total globulins was found at V12. 60% of patients with ID at V0 achieved normalization of iron status at V12 with a significant association with the increase of FEV1 (moderate size effect: 0.68). A lower decrease of C reactive protein was significantly associated with the onset of ID in a small sample of patients (p < 0.001). The disappearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in sputum at V12 was not correlated to the evolution of iron status under ETI. ETI was associated with a decrease of ID prevalence, and improvement of pulmonary function and a correction of systemic inflammation.",40389628,PMC12089272,10.1038/s41598-025-02296-1,,2025,"Lobbes H, Pereira B, Richard M, Roux-Perceval M, Durieu I, Reynaud Q.",Y,MED
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in cystic fibrosis: Case-control study from the French registry.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a significant complication in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), driven by hypersensitivity to Aspergillus fumigatus. This study aimed to identify factors associated with the development of ABPA in pwCF, using data from the French CF Registry (FCFR). We conducted a multicenter case-control study utilizing anonymized data from the FCFR, spanning the period from 2016 to 2021. A total of 312 ABPA cases were matched to 936 controls. Various clinical factors, including CFTR variants, nutritional status, glucose disorders, respiratory function, chronic bacterial colonization, and treatments such as antibiotics, corticosteroids, and antifungals, were analyzed. Multivariate analyses and logistic regression models were used to identify associations with ABPA. PwCF who received more frequent intravenous antibiotics (OR = 2.47, P = .013), long-term inhaled corticosteroids (OR = 1.82, P < .001), or antifungals (OR = 5.83, P < .0001) exhibited a higher likelihood of developing ABPA. Additionally, glucose disorders were significantly associated with ABPA (OR = 1.41, P = .03). In contrast, a higher body mass index (BMI >25 kg/m²) appeared to be a protective factor (OR = 0.47, P = .03). No significant associations were observed with lung function, CFTR variants, or chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. These findings suggest that certain clinical factors and treatments, particularly glucose disorders, frequent antibiotic use, and corticosteroid therapy, are associated with the development of ABPA in pwCF. Notably, a higher BMI may have a protective effect. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of these associations and optimize treatment strategies for ABPA in CF, especially as CF therapies continue to evolve.",40210589,PMC11992956,10.1093/mmy/myaf030,,2025,"Tarizzo M, Lemonnier L, Leblanc S, Bigot J, Thouvenin G, Guillot L, Corvol H.",Y,MED
The effect of modulators on lung function following inpatient treatment for CF exacerbations.,"Background: Modulator therapy restores CFTR function and has led to health benefits for persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) (PwCF), including lower rates of pulmonary exacerbations. It is unknown if modulators affect lung function trajectories after inpatient treatment of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx).Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of hospital encounters for PEx for subjects 6-25 years old with mild to moderate lung disease admitted to a large tertiary care center from 2014 to 2021 to capture hospitalizations of PwCF before and after starting modulators. Descriptive analyses were used to characterize the population and lung function findings. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between modulators and FEV1pp outcomes.Results: The study sample included 575 encounters representing 149 unique PwCF. Hospital encounters of PwCF taking modulator were associated with higher mean FEV1pp at baseline, midway, discharge, and follow-up assessments. Mean FEV1pp increased during inpatient treatment of PEx with loss of lung function at follow-up, regardless of modulator use. Hospital encounters of PwCF not taking modulators were associated with less significant improvements in mean FEV1pp from admission at both midway and discharge (15.6% vs. 18.3%, 19.9% vs. 22.5%, no modulator vs. modulator groups, respectively). At follow-up, hospitalizations of PwCF taking modulators were associated with a significantly higher probability of sustained improvement in FEV1pp from discharge (difference in probabilities 0.119, *p* < 0.05) and a lower probability of loss of lung function from baseline (difference in probabilities -0.123, *p* < 0.05).Conclusions: Hospitalizations for PwCF taking modulators were associated with higher lung function at all assessments. Hospitalizations of PwCF taking modulators were associated with a significantly higher probability of sustained improvement in FEV1pp following discharge and a lower probability of loss of lung function from baseline.",40918666,PMC12408314,10.3389/fped.2025.1654122,,2025,"Stone A, Haag MB, Muirhead CA, Markwardt S, MacDonald KD.",Y,MED
Respiratory Muscle Function in Children and Adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis in the Era of CFTR Modulator Therapies.,"**Objective**: The objective of this study was to analyze respiratory muscle function in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF) treated with Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI) compared to healthy individuals, based on the hypothesis that CFTR modulators may improve respiratory muscle strength. **Methods**: A descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted with patients with CF treated with ETI aged 6-18 years. Lung function, maximal expiratory and inspiratory pressures (MIP and MEP), diet quality (KIDMED), and physical activity levels (PAQ) were assessed. The student's *t*-test or the Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare differences between groups. The effect size was calculated with Cohen's d. Significance level was set as a *p*-value < 0.05. **Results**: A total of 48 children and adolescents (60.4% male) were analyzed in this study (24 healthy and 24 with CF). The participants with CF had mild pulmonary involvement. No significant differences were found in respiratory muscle strength between groups (MEPmax*p* = 0.440, MIPmax*p* = 0.206). Patients with CF showed lower KIDMED (*p* = 0.022) and PAQ (*p* = 0.010) scores. However, the MIP and MEP values observed in CF participants were higher than those reported in previous studies conducted before the introduction of ETI modulators. **Conclusions**: Children and adolescents with CF treated with ETI showed respiratory muscle strength comparable to that of healthy controls. Despite differences in lifestyle factors, these findings may reflect a positive impact of CFTR modulators on respiratory muscle function, although further longitudinal and controlled studies are needed.",40723074,PMC12293476,10.3390/children12070878,,2025,"García-Pérez-de-Sevilla G, Blanco Velasco Á, Yvert T, Sanz-Santiago V, Tirado AM, López Neyra A, de Manuel C, Ruiz Valbuena M, Pérez-Ruiz M.",Y,MED

Exploring Therapeutic Strategies for Pediatric Cystic Fibrosis: An In-Depth Comparative Review.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that profoundly affects the respiratory and digestive systems, particularly in pediatric patients. This comprehensive review aims to conduct a comparative analysis of various treatment modalities employed in the management of CF in children. We systematically evaluated current literature focusing on pharmacological interventions, airway clearance techniques, nutritional management, and emerging therapies, including gene therapy and personalized medicine. Our analysis highlights the efficacy, safety, and accessibility of these treatments through a comparative lens, examining performance across diverse patient populations. Key comparisons include standard therapies, such as CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators, versus traditional treatments and the effectiveness of airway clearance techniques in relation to lung function outcomes. We explore variations in treatment adherence and outcomes based on socioeconomic factors and healthcare systems. The review underscores the importance of individualized care plans tailored to the unique needs of pediatric patients. By synthesizing findings from clinical studies, meta-analyses, and expert guidelines, this review serves as a valuable resource for healthcare providers and researchers.

Decreased insulin dose-adjusted hemoglobin A1c in adults with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes treated with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor.,"Background: Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) became available for adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) in 2019, but its impact on CF-related diabetes (CFRD) remains unclear.Methods: A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted among adults with CFRD to examine the change in insulin dose-adjusted Hemoglobin A1c (IDAA1c). Linear mixed effects model (LMEM) analysis was used to investigate the change in IDAA1c between baseline and 24 months of follow up, comparing an ETI-treated group to an unexposed group. Baseline values were those documented at treatment initiation for the ETI-treated group and in March 2020 (±3 months) for the unexposed group.Results: A total of 49 adults were included, 39 were treated with ETI and 10 were not. Median [Interquartile range] time since CFRD diagnosis at baseline was 13 [7-18] and 14 [10-18] years, respectively (p = 0.610). In the ETI-treated group, mean weight increased by a 4.44 kg (95 % Confidence Interval, 95 %CI: 3.08 to 5.79, p < 0.001), insulin total daily dose decreased by 5 units (95 %CI: -9 to 0, p = 0.033), and hemoglobin A1c (%) decreased by 0.65 points (95 %CI: -0.96 to -0.34, p < 0.001). No change was observed in the unexposed group. LMEM analysis found a numerically significant association between ETI and decreased IDAA1c, estimated at -1.14 points (95 %CI: -2.35 to 0.06, p = 0.067) after adjusting for age, sex, time since CFRD diagnosis and the introduction of Metformin.Conclusion: A numerically significant association between ETI and IDAA1c decrease was observed in adults with established CFRD after 24 months of treatment, suggesting ETI contributed to improved glycemic control.",40688702,PMC12273438,10.1016/j.jcte.2025.100407,,2025,"Burnet E, Grunewald D, Larger E, Camus-Bablon F, Eisenhauer C, Mifsud F, Martin C, Honoré I, Kanaan R, Carlier N, Fesenbeckh J, Mosnier-Pudar H, Burgel PR.",Y,MED
"Cystic Fibrosis Treatment Landscape: Progress, Challenges, and Future Directions.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic autosomal recessive disorder that primarily affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. It results from variants in the CFTR gene, leading to dysfunctional chloride channels, thickened mucus secretion, and subsequent multisystem complications. Significant advances have been made in CF treatment, particularly with the development of CFTR modulators, which are unique to genotypes and have improved clinical outcomes in many people with CF. However, the benefits of these therapies are not universal, with a considerable portion of the CF population-especially those with rare mutations-still without access to effective treatment options. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiology and genetic basis of CF, explores current and emerging treatments, and discusses the ongoing challenges in the field.",40091461,PMC11963354,10.5152/turkarchpediatr.2025.24257,,2025,"Yıldız CA, Gökdemir Y, Erdem Eralp E, Ergenekon P, Karakoç F, Karadağ B.",Y,MED
Impacts and New Challenges with Highly Effective Modulator Therapies in Younger Children with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT) has been available for adults and young adults aged 12 years and over with cystic fibrosis for approximately 5 years, with real-world evidence (RWE) emerging that confirms the significant impacts of these novel medications in older patient groups. As licensing has been extended to younger children (2 years and above in some jurisdictions), we summarize the clinical experience of these medications in pre-school and school-aged children and compare how changes in the objective markers of the disease can be elucidated in younger children. We also discuss the different incidences and severity of side effect profiles, the efforts to mediate these in younger children, and the particular challenges in introducing novel medications into pediatrics. We speculate on the use of HEMT in younger infants and its potential use in prenatal care.",40648998,PMC12250177,10.3390/jcm14134625,,2025,"Uyangoda K, Dawson C, Gudka N, Brugha R.",Y,MED
Longitudinal Study on Clinical Predictors for Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis in Children and Young People with Cystic Fibrosis Highlights the Impact of Infection with *Aspergillus* and *Pseudomonas* and Ivacaftor Treatment.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a well-known complication in children and young people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and without treatment causes structural lung damage. We performed a longitudinal observational study to identify clinical risk factors for ABPA in a cohort of children and young people with CF aged 8 to 17 years at baseline. Anonymised annual review UK CF Registry data from 2009 to 2019 for patients aged 8-17 years in 2009 were collected, with lung transplant recipients excluded. Baseline characteristics are presented for the whole group and cross-sectional comparisons made according to the presence of ABPA or not in 2009. Longitudinal analysis from 2009 to 2019 was completed on the group without ABPA in 2009 to identify predictors for the subsequent development of ABPA using a complementary log-log regression model. In 2009, there were 1612 patients, of which 1420 were ABPA-negative and 192 ABPA-positive. *Aspergillus* colonisation (*p* = 0.01) and IV antibiotic use (*p* < 0.0001) were associated with having ABPA in 2009. Longitudinal analysis of the group without ABPA in 2009 identified male gender, younger age, lower lung function, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infection, and *Aspergillus* colonisation to be significantly associated with the development of ABPA (*p* < 0.0001). Ivacaftor was significantly associated with reduced ABPA (OR 0.46, *p* = 0.01) but not lumacaftor/ivacaftor (OR 0.64, *p* = 0.28). Chronic oral macrolide use was significantly associated with increased risk of development of ABPA (OR 1.30, *p* < 0.0001). This study shows that lower lung function, *Aspergillus* colonisation, and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infection in children with CF were associated with the development of ABPA, highlighting the need for enhanced surveillance in these patients. This is the first study to show a protective association of ivacaftor and ABPA.",39997410,PMC11855986,10.3390/jof11020116,,2025,"Chesshyre ELD, Enderby B, Shore AC, Warren FC, Warris A.",Y,MED
Personalized tobramycin dosing in children with cystic fibrosis: an AUC24-guided approach.,"Tobramycin is commonly used for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Currently, a standard dose of 10 mg/kg daily is used in all children. We aim to develop a population pharmacokinetic (popPK) model of tobramycin in children with CF and determine the: (i) effect of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators on tobramycin pharmacokinetics (PK); (ii) attainment of the commonly used serum steady state area under the concentration-time curve target (AUC24,ss) of 80-110 mg/L⋅h with standard dosing; and (iii) generate an optimized fully individualized dosing strategy to improve target attainment. Multicenter prospective observational study of children with CF aged 0-19 years receiving IV tobramycin who had ≥1 serum concentration measured. A popPK model was developed using nonlinear mixed-effect modeling, and simulations were performed to assess study aims. Overall, 63 children had 450 serum tobramycin concentrations. A one-compartment popPK model, including age, weight, a renal maturation model, and estimated glomerular filtration rate as covariates, was developed. With standard dosing, 1/3 of children achieved the target AUC24,ss with younger children (<2 years) having the lowest probability of target attainment (PTA) (15%). The optimized dosing regimen improved target attainment in all children, increasing the PTA in children <2 years to 62%. CFTR modulator drugs did not affect tobramycin PK. Standard tobramycin dosing in children with CF achieves poor attainment of target serum AUC24,ss, particularly in children <2 years. A fully individualized approach (available at https://www.kidscalc.org/) improved target attainment in all children. CFTR modulators had a negligible effect on tobramycin PK.",40698812,PMC12406653,10.1128/aac.00278-25,,2025,"Harwood KH, Duffull S, Shanthikumar S, Lei A, Ranganathan S, Robinson P, Sandaradura I, Lai T, Gwee A.",Y,MED
"Inflammation in preschool cystic fibrosis is of mixed phenotype, extends beyond the lung and is differentially modified by CFTR modulators.","Background: Early-life inflammation has long been recognised as a key pathophysiological process in the evolution of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Despite this, no CF-specific anti-inflammatory treatments have been developed. This is crucial even in the era of highly effective modulator therapy as recent evidence suggests that modulators alter, but may not fully resolve, pulmonary inflammation.Methods: In this study, we used clinical microbiology data, high-dimensional flow cytometry and multiplex immunoassays to compare pulmonary (bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)) and systemic immunity in 70 preschool children with CF and a total of 32 age-matched preschool controls.Results: We show that inflammation in the early-life CF lung is characterised by innate cell infiltration (neutrophils: 31.31 vs 1.8% of BAL in CF compared with controls, FDRp=0.0001; eosinophils: 0.55 vs 0.06%, FDRp=0.001, and monocytes: 1.91 vs 0.45%, FDRp=0.004) and widespread upregulation of both traditional and type 2 inflammatory soluble signatures (40 analytes significantly elevated in BAL of CF compared with controls, all FDRp<0.1). Key targetable features of this response included pulmonary interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-13 which were most significantly associated with neutrophilic and eosinophilic infiltration, respectively (IL-8 and neutrophils; Spearman rho=0.68, FDRp=0.002: IL-13 and eosinophils; Spearman rho=0.75, FDRp=0.01). Signatures of type 2 inflammation, as identified by REACTOME pathway analysis, including IL-4, IL-13 and FGF-2, were highly elevated in both the lungs and circulation in early CF. When exploring the efficacy of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator modulators to resolve pulmonary and systemic inflammation in early life, we showed that different classes of modulators have varying effects on inflammation, with ivacaftor showing a more significant effect in the lungs and circulation than lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Finally, we showed that CF children with pathogen colonisation had similar levels of pulmonary inflammation as CF children without pathogen colonisation (no significant differences), and that inflammation was evident during infancy even without evidence of colonisation (as observed by significant increases in levels of SDF-1alpha, M-CSF, IL-2, IL-9, IL-12p40, IL-17, MCP-1 and LIGHT/TNFSF14, all FDRp<0.1), highlighting a role for intrinsic dysregulation of inflammation that begins in early life.Conclusions: We provide a rationale for targeted anti-inflammatory intervention in early-life CF.",39929713,PMC12322466,10.1136/thorax-2024-221634,,2025,"Shanthikumar S, Gubbels L, Wong ATC, Walker H, Ranganathan SC, Neeland MR.",Y,MED

Recently, a targeted therapy for CF has been developed, represented by the CFTR modulators that enhance or restore the function of the CFTR protein. The most recent is the combination of three modulators, Elexacaftor, Tezacaftor, and Ivacaftor (ETI). This study describes the presentation, management, and follow-up of tracheal diverticulum (TD) in pwCF receiving ETI therapy. **Methods**: This retrospective study included people with CF (pwCF) on ETI treatment and followed up in two CF Italian centers who developed an asymptomatic TD, diagnosed incidentally at chest CT scan. **Results**: Among 268 pwCF receiving ETI, three (1.19%) were diagnosed with TD identified after chest CT and were included in this study. Endoscopic confirmation was obtained in one patient. All patients were on inhaled colistimethate, two of them for chronic *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* colonization, and one undergoing eradication therapy. **Conclusions**: TD may be identified in chest CT obtained in pwCF in treatment with ETI.

Sex disparities in cystic fibrosis in the era of highly effective modulator treatment.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive lung disease and extra-pulmonary manifestations with notable sex disparities in disease outcomes. In this review we summarize the underlying mechanisms driving this sex disparity, with a particular focus on the role of sex hormones on CF lung disease pathophysiology. We explore how the introduction of highly effective modulator therapies (HEMT) may impact sex differences in outcomes and assess whether they have the potential to close the sex gap. While treatment with HEMT has led to better outcomes in the CF population as a whole, females with CF continue to experience worse pulmonary morbidity than males.

Current Status of Cystic Fibrosis in Türkiye: Data from the National Registry.,"Objective: The Cystic Fibrosis Registry of Türkiye (CFRT) was established by the Turkish Pediatric Respiratory Diseases and Cystic Fibrosis Society and has provided detailed information on demographic, clinical, genetic, and treatment-related aspects of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients since 2017. We aimed to describe the current status of CF in Türkiye using CFRT's 2023 annual data.Material and methods: Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were taken from CFRT's 2023 record.Results: In 2023, 2,258 patients from 34 centers were recorded. The median age of patients was 9.1 years, and 46.9% were female, with a median age at diagnosis of 0.3 years. Only 14.9% of the patients were older than 18 years. Genetic analyses were completed in 97.3% of patients. The most common variant, F508del, had a total variant frequency of 22.1%.

Effect of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor on systemic inflammation in cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Despite significant clinical improvements, there is evidence of persisting airway inflammation in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) established on elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) therapy. As CF is a multi-system disease, systemic immune profiles can reflect local inflammation within the lungs and other organs. Understanding systemic inflammation after ETI therapy may reveal important translational insights. This study aims to profile systemic inflammatory changes and relate these to the well-documented improvements observed with ETI therapy.Methods: We conducted a single-centre longitudinal study with 57 CF subjects initiating ETI therapy. All participants were Phe508del homozygous or Phe508del/minimal function. Blood samples were collected pre-ETI and 3-12 months post-therapy initiation. Analyses included mass spectrometry-based proteomics, a multiplex immunoassay, and flow cytometry for peripheral immune cell counts and phenotype. Controls samples were provided by 29 age-matched healthy controls.Results: Systemic inflammation reduced with ETI therapy; however, the immune profile remained distinct from healthy controls. ETI reduced neutrophil counts and was associated with a more mature, less inflammatory phenotype, as well as a shift towards an immune resolving state associated with increased CD206 expression. Cytokines known to influence neutrophil levels reduced with therapy. Despite ETI therapy, neutrophil and monocyte counts remained elevated compared with healthy controls. There was no obvious association between the ETI-related improvements in systemic inflammation and lung function.Conclusions: Patients with CF showed evidence of persisting systemic inflammation despite ETI therapy, which may have long-term potentially adverse effects on respiratory and other organ systems.",40447326,PMC12421123,10.1136/thorax-2024-222242,,2025,"Maher RE, Cytlak-Chaudhuri UM, Aleem S, Barry P, Brice DP, Caamaño Gutiérrez E, Driver K, Emmott E, Rothwell A, Smith E, Travis M, Lee D, McNamara PS, Waller I, Smith JA, Jones A, Lord RW.",Y,MED
Impact of CFTR Modulators on Longitudinal Cystic Fibrosis Survival and Mortality: Review and Secondary Analysis.,"Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator modulators (CFTRm) have transformed CF care, shifting treatment from only managing symptoms to also addressing the underlying defects that cause CF. CFTRm first entered clinical practice in 2012 and was followed by additional CFTRm combinations-including the approval of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) in 2019-which treats most CF genotypes.Methods: We identified peer-reviewed literature for a narrative review (January 1990 to January 2025) describing longitudinal trends in CF survival and age of death and assessing the influence of CFTRm, particularly ELX/TEZ/IVA. To supplement the existing literature, a secondary analysis of historical, longitudinal trends in the United States CF Foundation Patient Registry (U.S. CFFPR, 1990-2023) was conducted using recent available data.Results: Quantitative data from published studies show that the median age of survival and death increased over time but with varying magnitudes across regions. Most cohort and registry-based studies were conducted in settings where CFTRm were not yet widely available, limiting the evaluation of CFTRm effects on survival trends over time. In the secondary U.S. CFFPR analysis, the median survival age increased from 29.0 years in 1990 to 38.6 years in 2012 prior to the introduction of CFTRm and to 68.0 years in 2023, demonstrating substantial improvement following the introduction of CFTRm. Linear regression analyses showed gains in median survival age increased from 0.48 years per year prior to CFTRm to 4.79 years per year after approval of ELX/TEZ/IVA in 2019.Conclusions: Study results provide initial evidence of the impact of CFTRm to meaningfully improve survival. Longer-term follow-up data across geographies will provide a deeper understanding of the full impact of CFTRm on predicted CF survival and mortality.",40646419,PMC12373600,10.1007/s41030-025-00303-4,,2025,"Rubin JL, McKinnon C, Pedra GG, Morgan DA, Zweig K, Liou TG.",Y,MED

Cystic Fibrosis,"Cystic fibrosis is a chronic genetic disorder that has affected children and adults since ancient times, primarily affecting the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. Important chronic manifestations of cystic fibrosis include chronic lung infections, pancreatic insufficiency, sinusitis, and infertility. Cystic fibrosis is often associated with shortened lifespans, and the most common cause of death is end-stage lung disease. Historically misunderstood, cystic fibrosis gained recognition in folklore through the ""salty skin"" symptom, which symbolized an incurable condition. In medieval Europe, these children were believed to be cursed by witches and doomed to die. The curse that became folklore pronounced, ""Woe to the child who tastes salty from a kiss on the brow, for he is cursed and soon will die."" Salty skin was a sign of an impending illness without cause or cure. Until relatively modern times, cystic fibrosis was poorly understood. Modern understanding began in 1949 when scientists identified the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of cystic fibrosis and linked the disease to a defect in the CFTR protein, a chloride channel crucial for regulating salt and water balance in the body. Quinton postulated that sweat ducts in these patients were impermeable to chloride. Further studies led to the hypothesis that the faulty chloride channel must be situated in the apical membranes of the lung surface or glandular epithelium to explain the respiratory and systemic organ failure associated with cystic fibrosis. Symptoms may appear in infancy, childhood, or adulthood, with newborn screening and genetic testing aiding early diagnosis. The disease is caused by over 2,000 possible mutations in the CFTR gene, each disrupting chloride ion transport, leading to thick mucus accumulation, organ dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances. Advancements in treatment include CFTR modulators like ivacaftor and lumacaftor, which address underlying protein defects, and supportive therapies targeting nutrition, airway clearance, and infection control. Despite progress, cystic fibrosis remains life-limiting, with lung transplantation serving as an option for end-stage disease. Interprofessional care focusing on improving lung function, managing complications, and optimizing quality of life is essential for those with cystic fibrosis.",29630258,,,,2025,"Yu E, Sankari A, Sharma S.",Y,MED

Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis Receiving CFTR Modulators: A Comparison of Childhood Versus Adolescent Initiation.,"Background/objectives: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic disorder affecting multiple organ systems. This study compared clinical outcomes, hospitalization rates, and survival between children and adolescents with CF who received CFTR modulator therapies (ivacaftor, lumacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor).Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the TriNetX global collaborative network. Patients with CF aged 2-12 years (children) and 13-18 years (adolescents) who received CFTR modulator therapies were included. The propensity score matching balanced baseline characteristics between the two age groups.Results: After propensity score matching, 946 patients per group were analyzed. The incidence of respiratory failure (3.81% vs. 1.06%, *p* < 0.001) and respiratory infections (62.7% vs. 57.5%, *p* = 0.021) were significantly higher in adolescents compared to children. Adolescents had a higher risk of respiratory failure (HR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.79-7.21, *p* < 0.001) and respiratory infections (HR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01-1.17, *p* < 0.001). Adolescents also had a higher hospitalization rate (29.6% vs. 20.3%, *p* < 0.001), with a 47% higher risk (HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.22-1.77, *p* = 0.001), more hospital visits per person (8.8 vs. 3.7, *p* = 0.004), and longer hospital stays (32.7 vs. 20.4 days, *p* = 0.006). Mortality rates were similar between the groups (1.58% vs. 1.26%, *p* = 0.56).Conclusions: CF patients who initiated CFTR modulator therapies during adolescence had a higher incidence of respiratory failure, respiratory infections, hospitalization rates, and healthcare resource utilization compared to those who started therapy in childhood, despite similar mortality rates.

Cystic fibrosis therapy: from symptoms to the cause of the disease.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease with a broad clinical and genetic spectrum of manifestations, significantly impacting the quality and duration of life of patients. At present, a diagnosis of CF enables the disease to be identified at the earliest stages of its development. The accelerated advancement of scientific knowledge and contemporary research techniques has transformed the methodology employed in the treatment of CF, encompassing a spectrum of approaches from symptomatic management to pathogenetic therapies. Pathogenetic therapy represents an approach to treatment that aims to identify methods of restoring the function of the CFTR gene. The objective of this review was to analyse and summarize the available scientific data on the pathogenetic therapy of CF. This paper considers various approaches to the pathogenetic therapy of CF that are based on the use of targeted drugs known as CFTR modulators. The article presents studies employing gene therapy techniques for CF, which are based on the targeted delivery of a normal copy of the CFTR gene cDNA to the respiratory tract via viral or non-viral vectors. Some studies have demonstrated the efficacy of RNA therapeutic interventions in restoring splicing, promoting the production of mature RNA, and increasing the functional expression of the CFTR protein. The review also analyzes literature data that consider methods of etiotropic therapy for CF, which consists of targeted correction of the CFTR gene using artificial restriction enzymes, the CRISPR/Cas9 system and a complex of peptide-nucleic acids. In a prospective plan, the use of cell therapy methods in the treatment of lung damage in CF is considered.",40297296,PMC12036567,10.18699/vjgb-25-31,,2025,"Kireeva TN, Zhigalina DI, Skryabin NA.",Y,MED

Patients underwent regular evaluations, including clinical, functional, and microbiological assessments, alongside completion of quality of life, anxiety, and depression questionnaires. We evaluated whether there was a difference in anxiety and depression levels over time.Results: After 12 months of treatment, significant improvements were noted in BMI, lung function (FEV1%), ST and various aspects of quality of life (CFQ-R). However, anxiety and depression levels did not differ significantly during the follow-up. When we stratified our sample by key groups, we observed that younger patients (under 28 years) and those with homozygous Phe508del mutations experienced significant higher anxiety with no differences on depression. Furthermore, anxiety and depression demonstrated a moderate correlation, strengthening over time.Conclusions: Treatment with ETI establishes significant improvements in lung function, BMI, ST and quality of life in patients with CF.

Additionally, we investigated effects of lum/iva on exacerbations, anthropometry, sweat chloride and safety in children with CF in the Netherlands.Methods: Children with CF aged 6-18 years and homozygous for F508del treated in one of the seven Dutch CF centers for at least 12 months were eligible. Data were extracted from the Dutch CF Registry and electronic patient records. Primary outcome was change in percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) after 12 months.Results: Nationwide, 247 children with CF were eligible for lum/iva. Eight patients discontinued lum/iva due to side effects. In total, 223/247 children (90.3%) were evaluated. Mean (range) age at baseline was 11.0 (6.0-17.1) years. There was no change in FEV1 after 12 months of lum/iva. In a subgroup, markers of small airway function and structural lung disease, such as LCI (n = 28), mean change (SD) -10.0% (15.8), and bronchus-artery (BA) analysis on CT scan (n = 81), showed significant improvement (p < 0.01). Moreover, BMI (n = 192), exacerbations (n = 219) and sweat chloride measurements (n = 105) improved.Conclusion: Lum/iva was generally well tolerated in a real-life, nationwide pediatric cohort. The efficacy of lum/iva was comparable to phase 3 studies in children. LCI and BA analysis as markers of small airway and structural lung disease showed significant improvement which indicates the importance of these parameters to evaluate treatment effects of CF modulators in children.",39785291,PMC11715133,10.1002/ppul.27473,,2025,"Zwitserloot AM, Aziz SZ, Chen Y, Bannier MAGE, Janssens HM, Merkus PFJM, Nuijsink M, Terheggen-Lagro SWJ, Tiddens HAWM, Zomer-van Ommen DD, Vonk JM, de Winter-de Groot KM, Willemse BWM, Koppelman GH.",Y,MED
Cutting-Edge Advances in Cystic Fibrosis: From Gene Therapy to Personalized Medicine and Holistic Management.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder characterized by mutations in the CFTR gene, has seen significant advances in treatment through cutting-edge approaches such as gene therapy and personalized medicine. This review examines the current and emerging strategies shaping CF care, focusing on novel therapies that target the root cause of CF and optimize patient outcomes. CFTR modulators have transformed cystic fibrosis management by enhancing protein function for specific mutations, leading to improved lung function and quality of life. Concurrently, gene therapy offers transformative potential by aiming to correct CFTR mutations using tools like CRISPR/Cas9 or prime editing, though challenges remain in delivery and long-term efficacy. The integration of precision medicine, facilitated by genomic and computational technologies, allows for personalized treatment plans that account for genetic variability and disease severity. Complementing these approaches, holistic management emphasizes the importance of psychological support and nutritional optimization, acknowledging CF's multi-system impact. Future directions include exploring anti-inflammatory agents and microbiome modulation to further mitigate disease morbidity. However, global disparities in treatment access continue to challenge equitable healthcare delivery, underscoring the need for policy reform and international cooperation. By synthesizing these developments, this review highlights the transformative potential of modern CF treatments, advocating for continued innovation and global healthcare equity, with the ultimate goal of dramatically improving life expectancy and quality of life for individuals with CF.",40282362,PMC12026723,10.3390/genes16040402,,2025,"Parisi GF, Terlizzi V, Manti S, Papale M, Pecora G, Presti S, Tosto M, Leonardi S.",Y,MED
SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in overweight and obese patients with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes: Case series.,"Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is the most prevalent extrapulmonary comorbidity in CF. While insulin remains the standard treatment, increasing rates of overweight and obesity due to CFTR modulators highlight the need for new therapies. SGLT2 inhibitors, effective in type 2 diabetes, have not been studied in CFRD. This case series presents eight CFRD patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors alongside insulin for one year. Half had BMI reductions (1.33-2.89 kg/m2); others had increases. Glycemic control improved in six, worsened in two due to insulin nonadherence. Insulin adjustments showed no pattern.

Ceftobiprole in cystic fibrosis: a case series.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance (*CFTR*) gene, resulting in the secretion of hyperviscous mucus. Infective exacerbations are a major determinant of morbidity and mortality in CF patients. These infections are clinically challenging, and antimicrobial treatment should effectively target the organisms and be delivered early to improve survival. Ceftobiprole is a fifth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is not indicated for the treatment of CF. However, due to its activity against common causes of infective exacerbations in CF such as *Staphylococcus aureus,* including MRSA, and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* where resistance has not developed, it has utility for managing infective exacerbations.Objectives: To describe the use of ceftobiprole in the treatment of infective exacerbations in CF.Patients and methods: Ten patients with CF (age 24-63; six male and four female) were treated with ceftobiprole for infective exacerbations following discussion within the multi-disciplinary team. In most patients, ceftobiprole was given concomitantly with other antibiotics.Results: All patients had positive sputum cultures for *S. aureus* (including nine MRSA), and seven patients had concomitant *P. aeruginosa* infection. Ceftobiprole treatment was associated with improved lung function, and markers of systemic inflammation decreased for most patients, with some variation. There was good tolerability in all but four patients.Conclusions: Ceftobiprole presents a therapeutic option for susceptible infections in CF patients with limited treatment options. Its broad-spectrum coverage may help to reduce polypharmacy. However, further clinical studies are needed.",40391172,PMC12086531,10.1093/jacamr/dlaf077,,2025,"Nwankwo L, Schelenz S, Ramadan N.",Y,MED
Improved Clinical Outcomes With Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis and Advanced Lung Disease: Real-World Evidence From an Italian Single-Center Study.,"The combination of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI) has resulted in a significant improvement in lung function and global clinical parameters, which have not been previously achieved with other CFTR modulators. However, there is a paucity of evidence in the literature on the long-term use of ETI in adolescents and patients with severe pulmonary impairment. Furthermore, the response to ETI may differ between homozygotes and heterozygotes, as well as between naïve patients and those previously treated with other CFTR modulators. A retrospective study was conducted to examine changes in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV1), body-mass index (BMI), and sweat chloride concentration (SwCl) at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24 months after the initiation of ETI. Secondary outcomes included the number of pulmonary exacerbations, Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) score, adverse events, mortality and transplantation rates. 139 subjects were included and followed up for up to 2 years after starting ETI. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in ppFEV1 and BMI after 12 months of therapy (respectively, 16%, p < 0.001; +1.5 kg/m2, p = 0.005), with a slight decline in the values after 24 months. This effect was independent of genotype and showed a different degree of response in naïve subjects compared to patients previously treated with other CFTR modulators. SwCl decreased from 84 to 37 mmol/L over 24 months (p < 0.001). 58.3% reduction of PEx rate was observed compared to the number of exacerbations prior to ETI. Overall, lung function, SwCl, PEx rate, CFQ-R scores and BMI improved after 24 months of ETI treatment. ETI was well tolerated, and none of the patients interrupted the treatment due to toxicity.",40176392,PMC11965699,10.1002/prp2.70083,,2025,"Perrotta N, Fiorito LA, Casini G, Gentile R, Vescovo R, Piciocchi A, Lobello R, Cappelli C, Poscia R, Cimino G.",Y,MED
Efficacy of Trikafta (ELX/TEZ/IVA) & Symdeko (TEZ/IVA) in Treating Cystic Fibrosis with F508del Allele: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The objective of the study was to assess and compare the efficacy of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) treatment with TEZ/IVA treatment in individuals diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF) and carrying the F508del allele. An extensive search of relevant literature was conducted using online resources, namely, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The initial search identified 248 articles, and after a careful examination of the full text of 18 articles, 7 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These selected reports were then thoroughly examined to perform a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of TEZ/IVA versus ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF patients with the F508del allele. The quality of the selected reports was evaluated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized studies, known as RoB 2. ELX/TEZ/IVA has shown significant improvements in key indicators of CF treatment. It has demonstrated a significant increase in forced expiratory volume in one second levels, indicating improved respiratory capacity and airflow. Additionally, ELX/TEZ/IVA successfully reduced sweat chloride levels and positively impacted Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised Respiratory Domain scores, reflecting enhanced respiratory function and improved quality of life for patients. Overall, the study concluded that ELX/TEZ/IVA provided a clinically robust benefit compared to TEZ/IVA alone while maintaining a favourable safety profile.",40336353,PMC12365565,10.4274/thoracrespract.2025.2025-1-1,,2025,"Hussain K, Karhana S, Garg A, Khan MA.",Y,MED
Effect of cystic fibrosis modulator therapies on serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins.,"This is a prospective, multicenter study of a cohort of 224 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients treated with CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators (CFTRm). Our aim was to prospectively analyze the effect of CFTRm treatment on fat-soluble vitamin serum levels. Demographic and clinical data were recorded, and fat-soluble vitamin levels were analyzed at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months after starting treatment. Two groups were analyzed separately: patients receiving dual therapy lumacaftor/ivacaftor or tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Lum/Tez+Iva), and those on triple therapy with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). We found that treatment with ETI produced a significant increase in vitamin D and A levels within the first 6 months, which was maintained at 12 months. However, with dual therapy, we observed an increase only in vitamin A levels within the first 6 months, which was not maintained at 12 months.

The Frequency and Potential Implications of HFE Genetic Variants in Children With Cystic Fibrosis.,"Background: Genetic modifiers have been identified that increase the risks of lung disease and other complications, such as diabetes in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Variants in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) were reported in a study of adults to be associated with worse lung disease.Objectives: To ascertain the frequency of HFE variants, particularly C282Y (c.845G > A) and H63D (c.187C > G) and to determine if they are associated with variations in the onset and early severity of CF lung disease as well as abnormalities in iron status.Design: We studied with whole genome sequencing and clinical outcome measures in a cohort of 104 children with CF at 5-6 years old who were previously found to show an association between aggregated genetic modifiers and an earlier onset and a more severe lung disease phenotype.Results: In our cohort, 23% have H63D and 11% have C282Y. Lung function at age 6 years and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections did not differ by HFE variants, but having C282Y was associated with more pulmonary exacerbations in the first 6 years of life. Three patients have H63D/C282Y genotype, and all showed phenotypic expression of hemochromatosis with abnormal iron indices.Conclusion: Our study revealed that the presence of HFE variant C282Y in people with CF may lead to more severe lung disease manifestations beginning in early childhood. There is a risk of hemochromatosis in CF patients with two HFE variants, and thus they should be followed for evidence of iron overload.",40071665,PMC11898569,10.1002/ppul.71042,,2025,"Huang L, Lai HJ, Furuya KN, Antos NJ, Asfour F, Boyne KL, Howenstine M, Rock MJ, Sawicki GS, Gaffin JM, Worthey EA, Farrell PM.",Y,MED
Innate Immunity in Cystic Fibrosis: Varied Effects of CFTR Modulator Therapy on Cell-to-Cell Communication.,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening, multi-organ disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Prominent clinical features of CF take place in the lung, hallmarked by cycles of bacterial infection and a dysfunctional inflammatory airway response, leading to eventual respiratory failure. Bidirectional crosstalk between epithelial cells, leukocytes (e.g., neutrophils, macrophages) and bacteria via release of intra-cellular mediators is key to driving inflammation in CF airways. In recent years, a highly effective combination of therapeutics targeting the CFTR defect have revolutionized treatment in CF. Despite these advancements and due to the complexity of the immune response in the CF airway, the full impact of highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT) on airway inflammation is not fully determined. This review provides the evidence to date on crosstalk mechanisms between host epithelium, leukocytes and bacteria and examines the effect of HEMT on both soluble and membrane-derived immune mediators in clinical samples. The varied effects of HEMT on expression of key proteases, cytokines and extracellular vesicles (EVs) in relation to clinical parameters is assessed. Advances in treatment with HEMT have shown potential in dampening the chronic inflammatory response in CF airways. However, to fully quell inflammation and maximize lung tissue resilience, further interventions may be necessary. Exploring the effects of HEMT on key immune mediators paves the way for identifying new anti-inflammatory approaches targeting host immune cell interactions, such as EV-directed lung therapies.",40141278,PMC11942055,10.3390/ijms26062636,,2025,"Hynes J, Taggart CC, Tirouvanziam R, Coppinger JA.",Y,MED
Efficacy of Long-Term Use of Azithromycin in the Management of Cystic Fibrosis in Pediatric Patients with or Without *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Article.,"*Background and Objectives:* In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to discover the overall efficacy of azithromycin in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and with or without *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infection, specifically regarding its effect on respiratory parameters such as forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in addition to its effect on exacerbations and the need to use additional antibiotics. *Materials and Method:* We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis by searching for all eligible articles on PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus published between inception and September 2024. We used the following search strategy for our searching process: ""Cystic fibrosis"" AND ""Azithromycin"" and ""Children"" OR ""Pediatric"" OR ""Infant"". We conducted the meta-analysis by pooling the mean difference (MD) and comparing the continuous variables and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous variables at 95% confidence intervals (CI), at a *p*-value of 0.05. *Results:* Azithromycin was observed to be associated with increased FEV1 compared with the control, showing an MD of 1.91 (95% CI: 1.09, 2.74, *p* < 0.00001) and non-significant heterogeneity. However, no significant difference was observed between azithromycin and control groups regarding FVC with MD = 0.62 (95% CI: -0.01, 1.25, *p* = 0.06). Compared with the control group, azithromycin was significantly associated with lower risk and a lower number of exacerbations, with OR = 0.48 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.67, *p* < 0.0001) and MD = -0.82 (95% CI: -1.32, -0.33, *p* = 0.001), respectively, with non-significant heterogeneity. Regarding the need for new antibiotic usage, azithromycin showed a significantly lower need, with OR = 0.35 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.94, *p* = 0.04), I2 = 75%, *p* = 0.02. No significant difference was observed between both groups regarding hospitalization rate, with OR = 0.88 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.4, *p* = 0.59). *Conclusions:* This systematic review and meta-analysis showed the efficacy of azithromycin in pediatric patients with CF, as it improved lung function by increasing FEV1, reduced exacerbations of CF, which is the most common symptom of CF that leads to mortality, and reduced the number of antibiotics that needed to be administered to patients with CF, which reduces the risk of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the long-term use of azithromycin is recommended for pediatric patients with CF as part of their treatment regimen.",40282944,PMC12029021,10.3390/medicina61040653,,2025,"Al-Shehri H, Albassam D.",Y,MED

One year of ETI reduces lung bacterial colonisation in adults with cystic fibrosis.,"The triple combination elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) has provided unprecedented clinical benefits for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) and drastically transformed the outcome of this disease. We aimed to describe the evolution of lung bacterial colonization in 198 French adult pwCF taking into account the use of concomitantly respiratory treatment. We collected sputum cultures produced during the entire follow-up period starting 3 years before and ending 1 year after ETI initiation. All sputum cultures were centralized and analyzed at our bacteriological laboratory. Clinical data included pulmonary function, respiratory treatments, physiotherapy, number of IV antibiotics treatment, as well as inpatient stays. We observed a significant decrease in colonization prevalence by any CF pathogen after one year of treatment with ETI (p < 0.001). This decrease was confirmed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MRSA and MSSA, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter spp. and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). The maximal density of bacteria documented in sputum cultures decreased from 2.107 CFU/ml to 1.106 CFU/ml after one year of ETI. We also found a decrease in prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa chronic colonization and in the density of Pseudomonas aeruginosa after one year of ETI. These results confirm the decrease in prevalence and bacterial density of lung colonisation for most of the CF pathogens, including Achromobacter spp, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia concomitantly to the clinical improvement. Further studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms of these microbiological changes.",39592637,PMC11599715,10.1038/s41598-024-77246-4,,2024,"Mianowski L, Doléans-Jordheim A, Barraud L, Rabilloud M, Richard M, Josserand RN, Durieu I, Reynaud Q.",Y,MED
A Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry Method for the Quantification of Cystic Fibrosis Drugs (Caftors) in Plasma and Its Application for Therapeutic Monitoring.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to defective chloride ion transport and thickened mucus in the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. CFTR modulators, including ivacaftor, lumacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor, have improved patient outcomes, but interindividual pharmacokinetic variability and potential drug-drug interactions require therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for optimal efficacy and safety. In this context, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of CFTR modulators and their major active metabolites in human plasma to support pharmacokinetic studies and routine TDM. The multiplex LC-MS/MS assay was established using plasma protein precipitation, followed by chromatographic separation on an Xselect HSS T3 (Waters®) column and positive electrospray ionization mode detection. The method was validated based on FDA and EMA guidelines for specificity, linearity, accuracy (89.8-107.8%), repeatability (1.1-8.1%), intermediate fidelity (1.3-10.9%), matrix effects, and stability, demonstrating a robust performance with excellent precision and accuracy. International interlaboratory comparisons confirmed the reliability of the assay. The developed method can be applied for the clinical monitoring of caftors' plasma concentrations and preliminary data suggest that it can also be applied to alternative matrices, such as breast milk. This method will serve to characterize caftors' pharmacokinetic variability and monitor drug-drug interactions to further refine personalized dosing strategies and enhance precision medicine treatments for patients with CF.",40363673,PMC12073025,10.3390/molecules30091866,,2025,"D'Atri V, Corrado F, Versace F, Saldanha SA, Mercier T, Guidi M, Thoueille P, Blanchon S, Koutsokera A, Vogeser M, Marzolini C, Girardin F, Mitropoulou G, Balmpouzis Z, Rochat I, Sauty A, Decosterd LA, Choong E.",Y,MED
The 2025 European Cystic Fibrosis Society position statement on physical activity assessment in cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Recent advances in the measurement of physical activity have significantly enhanced the analyses and interpretation in relation to health and well-being. Thus, we sought to revise and expand the 2015 position statement on the measurement of physical activity and provide guidance to clinicians and researchers for measuring physical activity in cystic fibrosis (CF) clinical practice and research.Methods: This study was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Review (PROSPERO) database (CRD42022292165). Three databases (Medline, Embase and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) were searched for studies investigating the measurement of physical activity and sedentary time in people with CF irrespective of age or duration. The Quality Assessment for Diverse Studies was used to assess methodological concern. A mixed-methods framework synthesis was used to extract, map, chart, categorise and aggregate study findings.Results: In total, 7439 potentially relevant publications were identified. Following screening of titles and abstracts, 422 full texts were retrieved and assessed for eligibility, with 90 studies included. There was considerable variation in the methods of assessment, data processing and analytical interpretation of data.Conclusion: It is recommended that device-based physical activity metrics are presented as time spent in different intensity categories (*e.g.*, light, moderate and vigorous) and to include sedentary and sleep time. For data analysis, the data resolution should be at least 1 s (minimum 30 Hz) to enable clinical teams to obtain representative categorisation of patients' physical activity patterns.

Understanding beliefs about elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor therapy in adults living with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: A person's beliefs about treatment influence their engagement and adherence to that treatment. The Necessity-Concerns Framework suggests that adherence is influenced by a person's judgement of their own need for treatment (necessity beliefs) and concerns about the potential adverse consequences of taking the treatment. This study was conducted to explore the Necessity-Concerns Framework for elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) therapy (Kaftrio) in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF).Methods: A total of 64 adults with CF were maintained on ETI therapy as part of their routine CF care, and completed the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire. Patient demographics, lung function, body mass index and quality of life using the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire Revised were collected as part of routine clinical care. Duration of ETI therapy along with medicines possession ratio was recorded.Results: Patients reported strong beliefs about the necessity of ETI therapy. The majority of patients (78%) reported low concerns about ETI therapy while 22% of patients reported high concerns. A small number of patients (n=4) had concerns which were stronger than their beliefs about necessity.Discussion: Patients reported strong beliefs in the necessity of ETI therapy.

The Aging Patient with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited condition that leads to multiorgan dysfunction, especially in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive tracts, with associated conditions including persistent pulmonary infection, liver disease, pancreatic insufficiency, and infertility. Historically, people with CF (pwCF) suffered a shortened lifespan due to complications of the condition, namely respiratory. The emphasis on center-based, multidisciplinary care and the widespread introduction of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy has resulted in pwCF living longer and healthier lives. Now they may encounter some of the health and social issues associated with growing older, which previously were not a typical experience for this population. In this article, we review relevant health issues for the aging CF population, including complications that arise from the condition itself, issues encountered due to treatment, and general conditions associated with aging that may manifest earlier or differently in pwCF. We discuss the recommendations for screening and treatment of relevant conditions, and considerations for the integration of healthcare professionals across disciplines into the care of this population.",40274760,PMC12148974,10.1007/s40266-025-01207-3,,2025,"Sullivan LJ, Mingora CM, Flume PA.",Y,MED

"New drugs, new challenges in cystic fibrosis care.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by variants in the gene encoding for the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a chloride and bicarbonate channel. CFTR dysfunction results in a multiorgan disease with the main clinical features being exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and diffuse bronchiectasis with chronic airway infection leading to respiratory failure and premature death. Over the past decades, major progress has been made by implementing multidisciplinary care, including nutritional support, airway clearance techniques and antibiotics in specialised CF centres. The past decade has further seen the progressive development of oral medications, called CFTR modulators, for which around 80% of people with CF are genetically eligible in Europe. CFTR modulators partially restore ion transport and lead to a rapid and major improvement in clinical manifestations and lung function, presumably resulting in longer survival. CFTR modulators have been game-changing in the care of people with CF. However, many questions remain unanswered, such as the long-term effects of CFTR modulators, especially when treatment is started very early in life, or the new CF-related disease emerging due to CFTR modulators. Moreover, severe complications of CF, such as diabetes or cirrhosis, are not reversed on CFTR modulators and around 20% of people with CF bear *CFTR* variants leading to a CFTR protein that is unresponsive to CFTR modulators. Challenges also arise in adapting CF care to a changing disease.

We aim to provide an overview of the PK of CFTR modulators in these populations.Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed and Embase on 20 June 2024. Studies were considered relevant when information on PK or exposure of CFTR-modulating drugs was available.Results: PwCF with mild/moderate hepatic impairment do not exhibit substantially higher exposure to CFTR modulators compared with those without liver involvement or healthy individuals. Similarly, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency has no effect on the PK of CFTR modulators in adult pwCF. In contrast, pediatric pwCF are exposed to higher levels of CFTR modulators relative to adults, as children receive higher weight-based doses (mg/kg) to ensure equivalent therapeutic efficacy.Conclusions: The PK of CFTR modulators have been more extensively studied in adults, pwCF with mild/moderate hepatic impairment, and children. However, ensuring adequate dosing remains challenging. Knowledge gaps persist for adults with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), children with CF-induced hepatic impairment, and pregnant or lactating pwCF. Future research addressing these gaps, through incorporating routine clinical data, is crucial for improving clinical guidelines and optimizing dosing regimens, thereby advancing towards evidence-based utilization of CFTR modulators.",40399734,PMC12185575,10.1007/s40262-025-01507-2,,2025,"Elzinga FA, Malik PRV, Akkerman OW, Rottier BL, van der Vaart H, Touw DJ, Koppelman GH, Mian P.",Y,MED
Evolution of Lung Disease Studied by Computed Tomography in Adults with Cystic Fibrosis Treated with Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor.,"Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) has shown clinical and spirometric benefits in cystic fibrosis (CF). CT remains a vital tool for diagnosing and monitoring structural lung disease. This study aimed to assess the evolution of lung disease, as evaluated through CT, in adults with CF after at least one year of ETI treatment. This ambispective observational analysis assessed lung CT scans performed before initiating ETI and after at least one year of treatment, using the modified Bhalla scoring system. For those patients with an earlier CT scan, a pre-treatment phase analysis was performed. Epidemiological, clinical, and functional parameters were evaluated. Results: Sixty-two patients were included (35 males, median age 30.4 ± 7.87 years). After at least one year of ETI, significant improvements were observed in the global CT Bhalla score (12.2 ± 2.8 vs. 14.0 ± 2.8), peribronchial thickening (1.4 ± 0.6 vs. 1.0 ± 0.4), and mucus plugging (1.6 ± 0.7 vs. 0.8 ± 0.6) (*p* < 0.001). Spirometry parameters increased significantly: the percentage of the predicted forced expiratory volume in the first second (ppFEV1) increased from 66.5 ± 19.8 to 77.0 ± 20.4 (*p* = 0.005) and forced vital capacity (ppFVC) from 80.6 ± 16.4 to 91.6 ± 14.1 (*p* < 0.001). Additionally, body mass index showed a significant increase. A moderate correlation was found between the Bhalla score and spirometry results. In the pre-treatment phase (*n* = 52), mucus plugging demonstrated a significant worsening, whereas global CT score, other subscores, and spirometry did not change significantly. Conclusions: In adults with CF, after at least one year of ETI, a significant improvement in structural lung disease was achieved, as reflected by the CT Bhalla score.",40278040,PMC12028220,10.3390/jimaging11040124,,2025,"Hernández-Muñiz S, Caballero P, Peláez A, Solís-García M, de Benavides C, Collada J, Díaz-Lorenzo I, Zorzo C, Gómez-Punter RM, Girón RM.",Y,MED
Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA) in the Era of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Modulators.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a hypersensitivity disease caused by *Aspergillus fumigatus* (*Af*), prevalent in persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) or asthma. In ABPA, *Af* proteases drive a T-helper cell-2 (Th2)-mediated allergic immune response leading to inflammation that contributes to permanent lung damage. Corticosteroids and antifungals are the mainstays of therapies for ABPA. However, their long-term use has negative sequelae. The treatment of patients with CF (pwCF) has been revolutionized by the efficacy of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy. Pharmacological improvement in CFTR function with highly effective elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) provides unprecedented improvements in lung function and other clinical outcomes of pwCF. The mechanism behind the improvement in patient outcomes is a continued topic of investigation as our understanding of the role of CFTR function evolves. As ETI therapy gains traction in CF management, understanding its potential impact on ABPA, especially on the allergic immune response pathways and *Af* infection becomes increasingly crucial for optimizing patient outcomes. This literature review aims to examine the extent of these findings and expand our understanding of the already published research focusing on the intersection between ABPA therapeutic approaches in CF and the rapid impact of the evolving CFTR modulator landscape. While our literature search yielded limited reports specifically focusing on the role of CFTR modulator therapy on CF-ABPA, findings from epidemiologic and retrospective studies suggest the potential for CFTR modulator therapies to positively influence pulmonary outcomes by addressing the underlying pathophysiology of CF-ABPA, especially by decreasing inflammatory response and *Af* colonization. Thus, this review highlights the promising scope of CFTR modulator therapy in decreasing the overall prevalence and incidence of CF-ABPA.",39330416,PMC11433030,10.3390/jof10090656,,2024,"Chatterjee P, Moss CT, Omar S, Dhillon E, Hernandez Borges CD, Tang AC, Stevens DA, Hsu JL.",Y,MED
Clinical Disorders in Cystic Fibrosis That Affect Emergency Procedures-A Case Report and Review.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystemic disease caused by a genetic defect, namely a mutation in the CFTR gene, that results in the production of an abnormal protein that regulates the flow of chloride ions through epithelial cells, leading to the dehydration of secreted mucus and changes in its biological properties. Chronic inflammation and recurrent respiratory infections progressively damage lung tissue, leading to respiratory and cardiorespiratory failure. This study aims to present a clinical case and explore the clinical changes in CF that may influence the provision of pre-hospital first aid. The study presents a case report of a 23-year-old CF patient undergoing evaluation for lung transplantation, infected with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Staphylococcus aureus* with the MSSA phenotype, and in a severe condition due to infectious exacerbation. Despite antibiotic treatment, the patient's condition deteriorated, leading to respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. Emergency measures were taken to maintain airway patency-the patient was sedated, intubated, and connected to a ventilator. CF involves systemic complications that, during exacerbations, may require urgent interventions. Cystic fibrosis is associated with multiple systemic complications, some of which may, during exacerbations, require emergency medical interventions. Providing care to this patient group involves specific procedures addressing the consequences of the underlying disease. Due to increasing survival rates and the emergence of new phenotypes, there is a need for the continuous education of medical personnel, including emergency responders, regarding the management of genetically determined diseases. This study underscores the importance of recognizing CF's complex nature and adapting emergency care accordingly to ensure timely and effective intervention in life-threatening situations.",40364218,PMC12072408,10.3390/jcm14093187,,2025,"Jarzynka S, Dobrosz M, Jaworski S, Jóźwicki K, Wierzba S, Barbarska O, Minkiewicz-Zochniak A.",Y,MED
Deleterious effect of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* on F508del-CFTR rescued by elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor is clinical strain-dependent in patient-derived nasal cells.,"Background: The triple cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators combination elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) has been approved for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) bearing at least one *F508del* allele. Despite the development of CFTR modulators having dramatically improved respiratory outcomes in pwCF, clinical studies have showed variable responses to this drug formulation. Of note, airway inflammation and bacterial colonisation persist in the upper and lower respiratory tract even in ETI-treated patients.Methods: We first tested the clinical exoproducts (EXO) of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* isolated from 15 CF patients in wild-type (WT) and F508del-CFTR CF bronchial epithelial (CFBE) cells. We were then prompted to evaluate the effects of EXO in *ex-vivo* patient-derived tissues. Therefore, we cultured primary nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) with EXO isolated from the corresponding pwCF to mimic the native status of CF airway.Results: We found that EXO variably decreased WT-, F508del- and ETI-dependent F508del-CFTR function and increased proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in a clinical strain-specific manner. Similarly, we observed a variable reduction of F508del-CFTR function in presence or absence of ETI and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and ROS levels. Interestingly, HNECs treated with EXO isolated from the corresponding donor and three different pwCF showed a variable reduction of ETI-dependent F508del-CFTR function mainly due to clinical strains with limited effect of patient background. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ETI pretreatment decreased the cytokines and ROS levels down to the levels of uninfected cells.Conclusion: These preclinical studies suggest that *in vitro* screening of patient-specific response to CFTR modulators under infection/inflammation conditions could prove to be a valuable tool to enhance the prediction of clinical response.",40432819,PMC12107384,10.1183/23120541.00970-2024,,2025,"Allegretta C, Montemitro E, Sgobba MN, Capurro V, Pesce E, Ciciriello F, La Bella G, Rossito M, Tuccio V, Arena F, Gunawardena TNA, Guerra L, Pedemonte N, Capitanio N, Piccoli C, Laselva O.",Y,MED
Cystic fibrosis: new challenges and perspectives beyond elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor.,"Over the past decade, major clinical advances have been made in the healthcare and therapeutic development for cystic fibrosis (CF), a lethal genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. CFTR modulators represent innovative treatments that directly target the primary defects in the mutated CFTR protein and have demonstrated significant clinical benefits for many people with CF (pwCF) who are eligible for these treatments. In particular, the triple combination therapy composed of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor (ETI) has changed the CF therapeutic landscape by significantly improving lung function, quality of life, and predicted survival rates. Here, we provided a comprehensive summary of the impact of ETI on clinical outcomes and the need for further research on long-term efficacy, side effects, pregnancy, possible drug-drug interactions, and extra-pulmonary manifestations. Moreover, a significant number of pwCF are unresponsive to these drugs or cannot afford their high costs. We, therefore, discussed health inequity issues and alternative therapeutic strategies under development aiming to obtain effective therapies for all pwCF.",40163448,PMC11960163,10.1177/17534666251323194,,2025,"Terlizzi V, Lopes-Pacheco M.",Y,MED
Real-Life in Cystic Fibrosis Pediatric Patients Treated With Kaftrio: A Descriptive Observational Study.,"In 2020, Kaftrio, a combination of Elexacaftor, Tezacaftor, and Ivacaftor, gained approval for treating cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients from the age of 12 years. This study aims to analyze 1 year of treatment with Kaftrio in pediatric patients, comparing their clinical characteristics with pre-treatment data. This is an observational, descriptive, and longitudinal study in patients with CF older than 12 years with at least 1 F508del mutation treated with Kaftrio for 1 year. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) z-score increased by +1.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.55 to 1.64), forced vital capacity (FVC) by +0.56 (95% CI = 0.10 to 1.04), and maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMEF) 25/75 improved by +1.53 (95% CI = 0.59 to 2.47). In addition, a reduction of 25.50 points (95% CI = -37.95 to -13.06) in sweat chloride levels was observed. Body mass index (BMI)-for-age z-score (WHO 2006/2007) increased +0.39 (95% CI = 0.02 to 0.77). A transient increase in cough and secretions was noted in 61.53% after starting treatment. Kaftrio improves lung function and BMI and also reduces respiratory exacerbations and sweat chloride levels.",40219783,PMC12379036,10.1177/00099228251330121,,2025,"García Díaz FJ, Moreno Ortega M, Medina Bethencourt M, Quintana Gallego ME, Carrasco Hernández L, Delgado Pecellín C, Delgado Pecellín I.",Y,MED
Real-World Improvements of Lung Clearance Index and Ventilation Distribution Efficiency in Children With Cystic Fibrosis After Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor Initiation.,"Introduction: Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) is a breakthrough therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF). We aimed to assess ETI's real-world impact on peripheral airway disease assessed as ventilation distribution inhomogeneity using nitrogen multiple breath washout (N2MBW) in children aged 6-17 years. Additionally, we compared the two outcomes, lung clearance index (LCI), and ventilation distribution efficiency (VDE), as VDE is considered to adjust for a theoretical overestimation of lung disease when using LCI.Methods: This nationwide study included data from N2MBW performed during routine clinical care. Linear mixed effect regression was used to assess changes in LCI and VDE after 12 months of ETI treatment. Subgroup analyses included baseline age (6-11 vs. 12-1 years) and disease severity (normal-moderate vs. severe-very severe).Results: We included 131 children (78% homozygous for F508del mutation, mean [SD] age 11.5 [3.4]), and 339 N2MBW tests. The median (range) number of tests per child was 3 (1-10). The estimated mean (95% CI) 12-months post-ETI improvement in LCI and VDE were 1.7 units (-2.1; -1.2, p < 0.001) and 2.1%-point (1.6; 2.6, p < 0.001), respectively. Similar LCI and VDE improvements were observed across age groups. Using VDE, fewer children were categorized with very severe lung disease, and the ETI-effect did not differ between the severity groups, unlike LCI.Conclusion: Our research demonstrates that ETI treatment significantly improves lung function, as measured by N2MBW, in Danish children and adolescents with CF. VDE improvements were consistent across age and disease severity groups. In contrast, LCI revealed larger effect estimates for those with severe to very-severe lung impairment.",40539675,PMC12180290,10.1002/ppul.71166,,2025,"Henriksen EH, Sandvik RM, Olsen MF, Pressler T, Bryrup T, Leo-Hansen C, Nielsen BU, Højte C, Skov M, Buchvald F, Mathiesen IHM, Qvist T, Olesen HV, Rubak S, Jensen CB, Faurholt-Jepsen D, Nielsen KG, TransformCF Study Group.",Y,MED
One-Year Effect of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor Therapy on HbA1c Levels and Insulin Requirement in Patients with Insulin-Dependent Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes: A Retrospective Observational Study.,"Introduction: The impact of ETI therapy on pulmonary function and nutritional status has been widely studied; the literature on the possible outcomes on glycemic control and insulin requirement in patients affected by CFRD is controversial.Aim: The main objective of our study was to evaluate HbA1c levels in patients with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) after one year of therapy with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). The secondary objective was to study the changes in the total daily insulin dose (TDD), pulmonary function and metabolism in this population.Materials and methods: A retrospective single-center observational study was conducted at the Regional Cystic Fibrosis Centre and Diabetology Centre of IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini. The observation period was divided into four different time points: initiation (T0), 3 months (T3mo), 6 months (T6mo) and 12 months (T12mo) of ETI therapy. Demographic and clinical data were collected. The results were then stratified by genotype (homozygous or heterozygous F508del).Results: Twenty-eight patients with CFRD undergoing insulin therapy were included. TDD (IU) significantly decreased at T3mo and T6mo, but not at T12mo, whereas HbA1c decreased significantly at all three times. The number of hospitalizations and pulmonary exacerbations decreased significantly.Conclusion: We demonstrated both improvement in glycemic control (by means of HbA1c) and insulin requirement in insulin-dependent CFRD patients after one year of ETI treatment.",39459609,PMC11509452,10.3390/life14101309,,2024,"Bassi M, Strati MF, Spiandorello G, Scalas M, Cresta F, Calevo MG, d'Annunzio G, Castellani C, Minuto N, Maghnie M, Casciaro R.",Y,MED
Intestinal current measurement detects age-dependent differences in CFTR function in rectal epithelium.,"Objective: Intestinal current measurement (ICM) provides a sensitive bioassay for assessment of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function in rectal biopsies *ex vivo* and is used as a diagnostic tool for cystic fibrosis (CF). Furthermore, ICM was shown to be sensitive to detect pharmacological rescue of CFTR function by CFTR modulators in people with CF carrying responsive *CFTR* mutations. Results from clinical trials of CFTR modulators across age groups indicate that CFTR function in the sweat duct may be age-dependent with children reaching higher levels than adults. However, little is known about age dependency of CFTR function in the intestinal epithelium.Methods: We investigated CFTR-mediated chloride secretion in rectal biopsies from 258 people without CF and 72 people with pancreatic-insufficient CF from 1 month to 68 years of age. Change in transepithelial short-circuit current in response to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated (100 μM IBMX, 1 µM forskolin, basolateral) and cholinergic (100 μM carbachol, basolateral) stimulation was assessed as a readout for CFTR function using perfused micro-Ussing chambers. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR of *CFTR* and morphometric analysis of epithelial cells lining the crypts and surface of the rectal mucosa were performed to assess regulation at the levels of gene expression and epithelial cell densities.Results: We found that CFTR-mediated chloride secretion across rectal tissues, as determined from cAMP-mediated as well as cholinergic chloride-secretory responses was highest during infancy and early childhood and declined with age in people without CF (both P < 0.001). Although, there was no difference in cAMP-mediated currents in people with CF, potassium-secretory responses induced by cholinergic stimulation were also reduced with increasing age. Transcript analyses showed that *CFTR* mRNA expression was slightly increased with increasing age in people without CF (P < 0.05). Morphometric analyses demonstrated that CFTR expressing colonocytes at the crypt base were decreased with age (P < 0.05). A secondary analysis of the ICM data of our previous studies on the effects of lumacaftor/ivacaftor on CFTR function in *F508del* -homozygous people with CF aged 12 years and older and 2-11 year old children showed correlations of the change in cAMP-mediated and cholinergic chloride secretory response with the age of people with CF (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively).Conclusion: These results demonstrate that CFTR function in the rectal epithelium is reduced with increasing age and indicate that this change is likely due to a decline in the number of secretory colonocytes at the crypt base. These findings suggest that differences in CFTR expressing cells may explain increased functional responses to CFTR modulator therapies in children compared to adult people with CF.",40066329,PMC11891205,10.3389/fphar.2025.1537095,,2025,"Graeber SY, Sommerburg O, Yu Y, Berges J, Hirtz S, Scheuermann H, Berger J, Duerr J, Mall MA.",Y,MED
The relationship between cancer risk and cystic fibrosis: the role of CFTR in cell growth and cancer development.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic disease that affects multiple organ systems. It is caused by a mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which results in the absence or damage of a relevant protein. If left untreated, it causes death in early childhood. The advent of more efficacious treatments has resulted in a notable increase in the life expectancy of CF patients. This has, in turn, led to an elevated risk of developing specific types of cancer. This review commences with an examination of CF from the standpoint of its etiology and therapeutic modalities. Subsequently, it presents a list of epidemiological studies that suggest an altered predisposition to certain cancers. A heightened risk is well documented, particularly in relation to the gastrointestinal tract. The following section addresses the role of CFTR in view of its potential involvement in the progression of various types of cancer. Several studies have indicated that the levels of the CFTR protein are reduced in many tumors and that this reduction is associated with the progression of the tumors. These decreased expressions are known to occur in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, bladder, and/or prostate cancer. Conversely, ovarian, stomach, and cervical cancer are connected with its higher expression. The final section of the review focuses on the molecular mechanism of action of the CFTR protein in signaling pathways that affect cell proliferation and the process of carcinogenesis. This section attempts to explain the increased predisposition to cancer observed in patients with CF.",40438286,PMC12107394,10.1039/d5md00203f,,2025,"Indra R, Černá V.",Y,MED
Improvements in Serum 25(OH)D Following Stoss Dosing in People With Cystic Fibrosis and Variable Adherence to Maintenance Regimens: A Retrospective Chart Review.,"Background and aims: People with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) often have vitamin D deficiency and require vitamin D supplementation. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of ultrahigh dose cholecalciferol (""stoss dosing"") in pwCF with variable adherence to maintenance cholecalciferol.Methods: Retrospective cohort study of pwCF who received initial stoss dose per protocol between January 2017 and November 2021 at University of Iowa Health Care adult and pediatric CF centers. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were extracted from the EMR. The increase in serum 25(OH)D concentration associated with receiving stoss doses was evaluated using a longitudinal linear mixed effects regression model.Results: Fifty-eight patients were included in the final analysis. The mean baseline 25(OH)D concentration before stoss therapy was 20.1 ng/mL (standard deviation [SD] = 5.9). The mean serum 25(OH)D concentration following stoss therapy increased to 27.9 ng/mL (SD = 7.5) and was measured on average 116 days after stoss administration. For patients with self-reported non-adherence to vitamin regimens, 16 out of 20 (80%) achieved a serum 25(OH)D concentration of at least 30 ng/mL after stoss therapy.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that stoss dosing was associated with increased serum 25(OH)D concentrations. This benefit also existed for individuals with self-reported non-adherence to maintenance cholecalciferol regimens with most patients reaching concentration goals.",40766771,PMC12322582,10.1002/hsr2.71142,,2025,"Gordon K, Chapman CG, Harklau NM, Ode KL, Wright BA.",Y,MED
Kidney effects of triple CFTR modulator therapy in people with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) is a new cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator that has transformed the respiratory prognosis of people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). However, its impact on other organs such as the kidneys, where CFTR is expressed, remains unclear. Since pwCF are risk of both kidney disease and urolithiasis, we aimed to study the potential effects of ETI on renal function, volume status, and risk factors for urolithiasis.Methods: This prospective, observational, single-center, before-after cohort study, involved adult pwCF eligible for ETI. The changes in plasma and urinary profiles were assessed by comparing renal function (using 2021 CKD-EPIcreatinine and 2021 CKD-EPIcreatinine-cystatin C formulas), volume status (using aldosterone/renin ratio and blood pressure), and risk factors for urolithiasis, at the time of ETI introduction (M0) and 7 months after (M7).Results: Nineteen pwCF were included. No significant change in renal function was observed between M0 and M7 (2021 CKD-EPIcreatinine: 105.5 ml/min/1.73 m² at M0 vs. 103.3 ml/min/1.73 m² at M7; *P* = .17). There was a significant reduction in aldosterone level (370.3 pmol/l at M0 vs. 232.4 pmol/l at M7; *P* = .02) and aldosterone/renin ratio (33.6 at M0 vs. 21.8 at M7; *P* = .03). Among the risk factors for urolithiasis, a significant reduction in magnesuria level was found (4.6 mmol/d at M0 vs. 3.8 mmol/d at M7; *P* = .01).Conclusion: These findings suggest that ETI seem to have no short-term impact on the renal function of adult pwCF and appears to correct secondary hyperaldosteronism due to excessive sweat losses. Further investigations are needed to determine the potential impact of decreased magnesuria observed under ETI therapy on the risk of urolithiasis.",39359568,PMC11443170,10.1093/ckj/sfae256,,2024,"Gabai P, Novel-Catin E, Reynaud Q, Nove-Josserand R, Pelletier S, Fouque D, Koppe L, Durieu I.",Y,MED

Redox Imbalance in Cystic Fibrosis: The Multifaceted Role of Oxidative Stress.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF), a severe genetic disorder stemming from mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (*CFTR*) gene, is characterized by a complex interplay of chronic inflammation and heightened oxidative stress, resulting in substantial patient morbidity. The diverse array of CFTR mutations, categorized into seven distinct classes based on their functional impact on the CFTR protein, presents a significant obstacle to effective therapeutic intervention. While CFTR modulator therapies offer clinical benefits, their applicability is restricted to specific mutation classes, leaving a considerable portion of the CF patient population with unmet therapeutic needs. This review provides a critical analysis of the intricate role of oxidative stress in CF, meticulously examining its origins, mechanistic pathways and downstream pathological consequences, with particular emphasis on lipid peroxidation (LPO). It elucidates the nuanced connection between LPO and inflammatory processes driven by cellular stressors such as endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment and persistent bacterial infections. Furthermore, it evaluates the current landscape of therapeutic proposals targeting oxidative stress, including antioxidant interventions, and explores the potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) as novel targets. This review aims to synthesize existing research to provide a comprehensive understanding of oxidative stress involvement in CF pathogenesis while critically appraising the advantages and limitations of current antioxidant therapeutic strategies.",40573184,PMC12195774,10.3390/ph18060784,,2025,"Artusi I, Rubin M, Cozza G.",Y,MED
The Promising Role of Intestinal Organoids in the Diagnostic Work-Up of Cystic Fibrosis Screen Positive Inconclusive Diagnosis/CFTR-Related Metabolic Syndrome (CFSPID/CRMS).,"Cystic Fibrosis Screen Positive Inconclusive Diagnosis/CFTR-related Metabolic Syndrome (CFSPID/CRMS) presents a significant clinical challenge due to its variable diagnostic outcomes and uncertain disease progression. Current diagnostic strategies, including sweat chloride testing and genetic analysis fall short in delivering clear guidance for clinical decision-making and risk assessment. Here, we comment on the potential of CFTR functional tests in patient-derived intestinal organoids (PDIOs) to enhance early risk stratification in CFSPID/CRMS cases. Using four hypothetical cases based on real-world data, we illustrate diverse clinical trajectories: diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF), reclassification as a CFTR-related disorder (CFTR-RD), non-CF designation, and persistent diagnostic uncertainty. Organoid-based assays-such as forskolin-induced swelling (FIS), steady-state lumen area (SLA) analysis, and rectal organoid morphology analysis (ROMA)-offer functional insights into CFTR activity and drug responsiveness. Compared to existing CFTR functional tests, such as Intestinal Current Measurement (ICM) and Nasal Potential Difference (NPD), these assays are more accessible, highly reproducible, and when needed support personalized medicine approaches. PDIO-based assays could help identify infants at high risk of disease progression, facilitating earlier interventions while minimizing unnecessary follow-ups for those unlikely to develop CF-related symptoms. Although not yet widely implemented, these assays hold promise for refining CFSPID diagnostics and management. Future research should focus on establishing standardized protocols allowing validation of clinical utility.",40700044,PMC12286166,10.3390/ijns11030052,,2025,"Rodriguez Mier N, Destoop M, Spelier S, Ramalho AS, Beekman JM, Vermeulen F, de Winter-de Groot KM, Proesmans M.",Y,MED
BOS-318 treatment enhances elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor-mediated improvements in airway hydration and mucociliary transport.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) triple modulator therapy, elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) has transformed care for people with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have eligible mutations. It is, however, not curative. Response to treatment also varies and lung disease, although slowed, remains progressive. We have previously demonstrated inhibition of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) by selective furin inhibition to be an alternative, mutation-agnostic approach that can enhance airways hydration and restore mucociliary transport (MCT) in CF. Inhibition of furin therefore, offers a potential therapeutic strategy for those ineligible, intolerant or nonresponsive to ETI and may provide a further opportunity for clinical benefit for those currently treated with ETI. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of furin inhibition on ETI responses to assess its utility as an adjunct therapy.Methods: Differentiated primary CF human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were treated with the highly selective furin inhibitor BOS-318 and with ETI. Ion channel function was measured using a 24-channel Transepithelial Current Clamp (TECC-24) system and airways surface hydration was investigated by measuring airway surface liquid (ASL) height and MCT rate.Results: The presence of BOS-318 had no effect on the ability of ETI to stimulate CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion but contributed a reduced Na+ transport *via* robust inhibition of ENaC. This altered ion transport profile effected an improved ASL height and MCT rate, which were significantly greater than improvements observed with ETI alone, demonstrating the benefits of the dual approach.Conclusions: Selective furin inhibition has the potential to further improve clinical outcomes for all people with CF and offers opportunity as an adjunct to improve responses to currently available CFTR modulator therapies.",40013020,PMC11863070,10.1183/23120541.00445-2024,,2025,"Douglas LEJ, Reihill JA, Martin SL.",Y,MED
Case Report: A delicate equilibrium of exocrine pancreatic recovery and hepatotoxicity with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor therapy in a pediatric patient with cystic fibrosis.,"This case report presents a comprehensive evaluation of the complex balance of therapeutic benefits and potential risks associated with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) therapy in managing an eight-year-old male with cystic fibrosis (CF) and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). While ETI therapy significantly enhanced exocrine pancreatic function, it led to hepatotoxicity, necessitating therapy discontinuation. Attempts to restart ETI at reduced doses were unsuccessful due to persistent hepatic dysfunction. Reduced ETI dosing frequency, implemented due to hepatic dysfunctions, did not result in substantial therapeutic benefits. Clinical markers showed a resurgence of severe EPI and sustained need for gastrostomy tube feeds, with only modest improvement in hepatic function compared to the period following ETI cessation or during prior use of CFTR modulator therapy with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. This case underscores the importance of personalized therapeutic approaches, biomarker-guided monitoring, and multidisciplinary insights to optimize CF management while also highlighting the ongoing need for research to mitigate hepatotoxicity risks and ensure long-term therapeutic efficacy.",39507496,PMC11538068,10.3389/fped.2024.1457517,,2024,"Coughlin MP, Sankararaman S, Roesch EA, Certo ED, Brej BL, Konstan MW.",Y,MED
"Unraveling the Mechanism of Action, Binding Sites, and Therapeutic Advances of CFTR Modulators: A Narrative Review.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a chloride and bicarbonate channel localized on the plasma membrane of epithelial cells. Over the last three decades, high-throughput screening assays have been extensively employed in identifying drugs that target specific defects arising from CFTR mutations. The two main categories of such compounds are potentiators, which enhance CFTR gating by increasing the channel's open probability, and correctors, which improve CFTR protein folding and trafficking to the plasma membrane. In addition to these, other investigational molecules include amplifiers and stabilizers, which enhance the levels and the stability of CFTR on the cell surface, and read-through agents that promote the insertion of correct amino acids at premature termination codons. Currently, four CFTR modulators are clinically approved: the potentiator ivacaftor (VX-770), either as monotherapy or in combination with the correctors lumacaftor (VX-809), tezacaftor (VX-661), and elexacaftor (VX-445). Among these, the triple combination VX-445/VX-661/VX-770 (marketed as Trikafta® in the US and Kaftrio® in Europe) has emerged as the most effective CFTR modulator therapy to date, demonstrating significant clinical benefits in phase III trials for patients with at least one F508del CFTR allele. Despite these advancements, the mechanisms of action and binding sites of these modulators on CFTR have only recently begun to be elucidated. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms could provide essential insights for developing more potent and effective modulators, particularly in combination therapies. This narrative review delves into the mechanism of action, binding sites, and combinatorial effects of approved and investigational CFTR modulators, highlighting ongoing efforts to broaden therapeutic options for individuals with CF.",39996840,PMC11854517,10.3390/cimb47020119,,2025,Baroni D.,Y,MED
The Pharmacokinetic Changes in Cystic Fibrosis Patients Population: Narrative Review.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare genetic disorder commonly affecting multiple organs such as the lungs, pancreas, liver, kidney, and intestine. Our search focuses on the pathophysiological changes that affect the drugs' absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). This review aims to identify the ADME data that compares the pharmacokinetics (PK) of different drugs in CF and healthy subjects. The published data highlight multiple factors that affect absorption, such as the bile salt precipitation and the gastrointestinal pH. Changes in CF patients' protein binding and body composition affected the drug distribution. The paper also discusses the factors affecting metabolism and renal elimination, such as drug-protein binding and metabolizing enzyme capacity. The majority of CF patients are on multidrug therapy, which increases the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI). This is particularly true for those receiving the newly developed transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), as they are at a higher risk for CYP-related DDI. Our research highlights the importance of meticulously evaluating PK variations and DDIs in drug development and the therapeutic management of CF patients.",39846711,PMC11755472,10.3390/medicines12010001,,2024,"Awaness A, Elkeeb R, Afshari S, Atef E.",Y,MED
Beyond the Lung. Impact of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor on Sinonasal Disease in Children With Cystic Fibrosis.,"Background: Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) is a Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) therapy that improves pulmonary function and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in cystic fibrosis (CF) adults with at least one copy of the F508del CFTR mutation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of ETI on CRS symptoms in children and adolescents with CF.Methods: The MODUL-CF observational study is a multicenter prospective cohort study enrolling CF children with at least 1 F508del mutation in France. Subjects answered a standardized questionnaire on nasal obstruction and smell and were invited to complete the Sinus and Nasal Quality of Life Survey (SN-5) questionnaire prior to ETI therapy and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months ETI. Part of the cohort underwent sinus computerized tomography (CT) within an ancillary study, scored by the Lund-Mackay CT score (LMKS).Results: Of 391 subjects, 94 (24.0%) were aged between 6 and 12 years, and 297 were adolescents. Sixty-four (16.3%) reported nasal obstruction at baseline. One hundred and sixty-three completed the SN-5 questionnaire at M0, 181 at M12, and 123 at M0 and M12. Mean SN-5 global score baseline value was similar to that of a healthy pediatric control cohort. SN-5 global score, nasal obstruction, sinus infection, and emotion domain subscores improved significantly at 1 month and this was sustained over 12 months. LMKS improved significantly in 43 patients who underwent sinus CT at M0 and M12.Conclusion: ETI improves sinonasal symptoms and related quality of life (QOL), including emotion domain, in children and adolescents with CF.",40047648,PMC12227108,10.1002/alr.23557,,2025,"Petitjean M, Letierce A, Bonnel AS, Reix P, Deneuville E, Stremler N, Luscan R, Couloigner V, Mely L, Bessaci K, Labbe G, Marguet C, Kelly-Aubert M, Hassani F, Sermet-Gaudelus I, Simon F, MODUL‐CF Study Group.",Y,MED
Impact of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in lung transplantation for cystic fibrosis in the United States.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive condition leading to progressive lung disease and often necessitating lung transplantation. Historically, CF has been one of the leading indications for lung transplants in the United States. The advent of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators, particularly elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI), has significantly improved clinical outcomes for people with CF (pwCF), offering potential alterations in disease progression and transplantation needs.Methods: Data on lung transplants performed in the United States since 1988 were retrieved from the Organ Procurement & Transplantation Network. Custom reports were generated to compare the number of lung transplants and waitlist additions before and after ETI approval in 2019. The analysis focused on trends from 2009-2019 (pre-ETI) and 2021-2023 (post-ETI).Results: The average annual lung transplants for CF decreased significantly from 243 (2009-2019) to 56.7 (2021-2023) post-ETI approval. Similarly, the average number of pwCF added to the lung transplant waitlist per year dropped from 295 to 55.6. Despite an overall increase in lung transplants and waitlist additions in the United States, the proportion involving pwCF has markedly declined post-ETI.Conclusions: The introduction of ETI has dramatically reduced the need for lung transplants among pwCF, reflecting significant improvements in lung function and disease management. These findings underscore the transformative impact of CFTR modulators like ETI on the natural history of CF, highlighting the importance of continued advancements in precision medicine for genetic disorders. Future studies should investigate long-term outcomes and sustained trends in lung transplantation needs among pwCF.",40144821,PMC11935324,10.1016/j.jhlto.2024.100171,,2025,"Pena TA, Wright B, Parekh KR, Kleney-Tait J.",Y,MED
Understanding the action of bamocaftor as a potential drug candidate against Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator protein: A computational approach.,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a hereditary condition and can cause permanent respiration problems leading to degraded life quality. The most common variation leading to CF is the F508del variation. CF can cause damage to not just the lungs but also digestive system, pancreas, and other organs. CF decreases the life expectancy of the individuals affected with the constant fear of lung complications. The current methods of treatment include using a combination of drugs to manage the symptoms. The combination of drugs has many side effects and causes damage to other organs like liver, heart or kidneys. In this study, we aim to find a drug that can relieve the symptoms of CF. We began by creating a dataset of potential drug molecules, which was subsequently refined by removing harmful compounds through an ADMET scan. All these compounds were then docked to the mutated Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) protein. The compounds with the best docking affinity were Galicaftor and Bamocaftor. A currently approved drug, Ivacaftor was selected as control for the 200 ns Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation. The simulation revealed that the CFTR protein remained more stable and compact when complexed with Bamocaftor, when compared to Ivacaftor and Galicaftor. Moreover, the MMPBSA free energy calculations revealed that the free energy of the CFTR-bamocaftor complex is the lowest compared to the other complexes. Our findings reveal the action of bamocaftor on CFTR protein with p.Phe508del variation. However, the absence of in-vivo or in-vitro studies is a limitation, and further experimental validation is necessary to confirm its efficacy and safety.",40700450,PMC12286342,10.1371/journal.pone.0328051,,2025,"Patel N, Sarkar S, V M BM, Kashyap I, Thiruselvam P, Sundararajan V, Lulu Sudhakaran S.",Y,MED

Patent Foramen Ovale and Oxygenation in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Introduction: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) affects about 25% of the population. We studied outcomes in cystic fibrosis (CF).Methods: We conducted a case-control study of patients with CF (PwCF) and age- and sex-matched controls who underwent agitated saline contrast (bubble) echocardiography, 1998-2020. We assessed PFO impacts using linear, logistic, quasi-Poisson, and Cox proportional hazards models.Result: Fifty-nine of 64 PwCF and 88 of 93 controls underwent bubble studies to investigate unexplained hypoxemia or dyspnea. PwCF had higher mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP: 6.9 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.35-11.4), reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE: -3.78 mm, CI = -5.64 to -1.93) and similar right ventricular diastolic sizes. Without hypoxemia, the PFO incidence was similar between PwCF and controls; with hypoxemia, PFO was more common in CF (odds ratio = 5.00, CI = 1.32-19.0). In CF, oxygen supplementation occurred at a percent-predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1%), 22.5 points higher with PFO. Adjusted for FEV1%, PFO was associated with 0.59 more prior-year pulmonary exacerbations (CI = 0.20-0.98) and shorter time to next exacerbation (hazard ratio = 1.86, CI = 1.06-3.26). Associations between PFO and hypoxemia or exacerbations were insensitive to PAP, TAPSE, and CF transmembrane regulator protein modulator treatments. PFO was not associated with CF time to death or lung transplantation (median 1.87 years) adjusted for age, sex, FEV1%, and prior-year exacerbation counts.Conclusion: PFO in CF is associated with hypoxemia at higher FEV1% and more pulmonary exacerbations but not survival.Introduction: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) affects about 25% of the population.

Impact of CFTR Modulation on Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection in People With Cystic Fibrosis.,"Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a multidrug-resistant pathogen causing recalcitrant pulmonary infections in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators have been developed that partially correct the defective chloride channel driving disease. Despite the many clinical benefits, studies in adults have demonstrated that while P. aeruginosa sputum load decreases, chronic infection persists. Here, we investigate how P. aeruginosa in pwCF may change in the altered lung environment after CFTR modulation.Methods: P. aeruginosa strains (n = 105) were isolated from the sputum of 11 chronically colonized pwCF at baseline and up to 21 months posttreatment with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor or tezacaftor-ivacaftor. Phenotypic characterization and comparative genomics were performed.Results: Clonal lineages of P. aeruginosa persisted after therapy, with no evidence of displacement by alternative strains. We identified commonly mutated genes among patient isolates that may be positively selected for in the CFTR-modulated lung. However, classic chronic P. aeruginosa phenotypes such as mucoid morphology were sustained, and isolates remained just as resistant to clinically relevant antibiotics.Conclusions: Despite the clinical benefits of CFTR modulators, clonal lineages of P. aeruginosa persist that may prove just as difficult to manage in the future, especially in pwCF with advanced lung disease.",38442240,PMC11420785,10.1093/infdis/jiae051,,2024,"Ledger EL, Smith DJ, Teh JJ, Wood ME, Whibley PE, Morrison M, Goldberg JB, Reid DW, Wells TJ.",Y,MED
Newborn Screening for Cystic Fibrosis Is Associated With the Lowest Healthcare Costs: A 10-Year Observational Follow-Up Study in France.,"Objectives: This study aims to study the healthcare (HC) costs associated with cystic fibrosis (CF) in children diagnosed prenatally (ANT), through newborn screening (NBS), after birth due to meconium ileus (MI), or later based on symptoms (LS). Additionally, it seeks to clinically characterize children with CF (chCF) with different trajectories of HC costs.Study design: A retrospective observational study was conducted on data from the French CF Registry (FCFR) and the French National Claims Database (SNDS) linked from 2006 to 2021. HC costs related to CF diagnosis circumstances were estimated per year of life among chCF up to age 10. Group-based trajectory modeling was performed to identify subgroups with similar cost trajectories.Results: Between 2006 and 2011, data from 1065 chCF were recorded in the FCFR. Nine hundred seventy-three (91.4%) were matched with SNDS, and 779 (73.1%) had at least 10 years of follow-up. During the first year, HC costs of chCF diagnosed with NBS were lower than for those diagnosed with MI and ANT (all p < 0.05). However, by the tenth year HC were no longer different between groups. Three groups with different cost trajectories were identified. Groups with the highest costs had a lower lung function at 6 and 10 years and the lowest weight and height z-scores at 2 and 10 years (all p < 0.05).Conclusion: NBS is associated with the lowest HC costs during the first year of life.",40396435,PMC12093448,10.1002/ppul.71134,,2025,"Guyot E, Deygas F, Belhassen M, Berard M, Van Ganse E, Sermet-Gaudelus I, Tiaiba S, Dubus JC, Durieu I, Reix P.",Y,MED
Effect of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulators and dedicated cystic fibrosis gastrointestinal clinic visits on the incidence of distal intestinal obstructive syndrome in persons with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) complications are the second most common disorders in persons with cystic fibrosis (PwCF). There is limited data on how having a dedicated CF-GI clinic and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators may affect rates of GI complications. Our aim was to assess the effect of the CF-GI clinic and CFTR modulators on GI complications with incidence of distal intestinal obstructive syndrome (DIOS).Methods: This was a retrospective study of adult PwCF who were seen in a CF-GI clinic from 2000-2023. Comparisons were made between the numbers of admissions and emergency department (ED) visits for DIOS at three years before and after CFTR modulator use and the first CF-GI clinic visit.Results: Of the 1,076 PwCF identified, 242 were seen in CF-GI clinic. Of this, 126 (52.1%) were female, with a median age of 40 (IQR: 30-47) years. There were 146 (60.3%) with regular use of laxatives. Of the 59 PwCF with CF-GI clinic visits for constipation, hospital admissions decreased in 16, were unchanged in 32, and increased in 11 (p = 0.402) while ED visits decreased in 9, remained the same in 40, and increased in 10 (p = 0.862). Of the 125 PwCF with CFTR modulator use, DIOS-related hospital admissions decreased in 15 patients, remained unchanged in 89, and increased in 21 (p = 0.021) while ED visits were fewer in 8, unchanged in 97, and increased in 20 (p = 0.587).Conclusion: PwCF had high burden of constipation with a majority of patients regularly using laxatives, and almost half had a history of DIOS.

"Lung function improvement on triple modulators: high-resolution, nationwide data from the Danish Cystic Fibrosis Cohort.","Background: People living with cystic fibrosis in Denmark had early, universal access to triple modulator treatment with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor. Close monitoring allowed us to assess the impact of treatment on lung function and progression of lung disease in an unselected nationwide cystic fibrosis population from 6 years of age.Methods: Data were analysed using linear mixed-effect models to assess changes in levels and annual rates of change (slopes) in percent predicted (pp) forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of FVC (ppFEF25-75%) between the 12 months pre-treatment and treatment periods. Subgroup analyses assessed the impact of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor among those with/without previous modulator treatment, normal/mild/moderate/severe lung disease at treatment initiation, children/adults and birth cohorts.Results: We included 392 people living with cystic fibrosis with a median (interquartile range) 12 (nine to 15) spirometry measurements per person. The mean (95% CI) improvement in ppFEV1 was 13.0 (11.3-14.6) 12 months after initiation of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor treatment. The annual rate of change improved from -1.4 (-2.1 - -0.6) ppFEV1 in the pre-treatment year to 2.7 (1.8-3.5) ppFEV1 per year during treatment. Similarly, ppFVC increased by 8.0 (7.1-8.9) and FEF25--75% by 19.5 (17.0-21.9).Conclusions: Using high-resolution data from a nationwide real-world setting, our study documents the impact of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor on lung function across subgroups based on age, disease severity and treatment history.

The potentiator ivacaftor is essential for pharmacological restoration of F508del-CFTR function and mucociliary clearance in cystic fibrosis.,"Pharmacological rescue of F508del-CFTR by the triple combination CFTR modulator therapy elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) leads to unprecedented clinical benefits in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, previous studies in CF primary human airway epithelial cultures demonstrated that chronic treatment with the potentiator ivacaftor can render the F508del protein unstable, thus limiting restoration of CFTR chloride channel function. Even so, quantitative studies of this unwanted effect of ivacaftor on F508del channel function with dependency on cell culture conditions remain limited, and the impact of chronic ivacaftor exposure on restoration of mucociliary clearance that is impaired in patients with CF has not been studied. In patient-derived primary nasal epithelial cultures, we found that different culture conditions (UNC-ALI medium vs. PneumaCult medium) have profound effects on ETI-mediated restoration of F508del-CFTR function. Chronic treatment with ivacaftor as part of ETI triple therapy limited the rescue of F508del-CFTR chloride channel function when CF nasal epithelial cultures were grown in UNC-ALI medium but not in PneumaCult medium. In PneumaCult medium, both chronic and acute addition of ivacaftor as part of ETI treatment led to constitutive CFTR-mediated chloride secretion in the absence of exogenous cAMP-dependent stimulation. This constitutive CFTR-mediated chloride secretion was essential to improve viscoelastic properties of the mucus layer and to restore mucociliary transport on CF nasal epithelial cultures. Furthermore, nasal potential difference measurements in patients with CF showed that ETI restored constitutive F508del-CFTR activity in vivo. These results demonstrate that ivacaftor as a component of ETI therapy is essential to restore mucociliary clearance and suggest that this effect is facilitated by its constitutive activation of F508del channels following their folding correction in patients with CF.",40261705,PMC12128954,10.1172/jci.insight.187951,,2025,"Balázs A, Rubil T, Wong CK, Berger J, Drescher M, Seidel K, Stahl M, Graeber SY, Mall MA.",Y,MED

Associations Between Socioeconomic Status and Adherence to Medications in People With Cystic Fibrosis.,"Background: Medication adherence is essential in managing cystic fibrosis (CF). The role of socioeconomic factors for medication adherence in people with CF is poorly understood, and their differential impact across the life course is underexplored. This study investigates associations between measures of socioeconomic status (SES)-educational attainment, household income, and health insurance type-and adherence to CF medications across age groups.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data collected during the validation of the Daily Care Check-In, a measure of adherence barriers in people with CF. Adherence was measured as a composite medication possession ratio (cMPR) averaged across five CF-specific medications, with data collected from pharmacy records. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected through self-report and medical record review.Results: A total of 405 participants completed the study, with an overall cMPR of 45.6%, lowest (38.5%) among young adults (aged 18-26 years) and highest (53.0%) among adolescents (aged 13-17 years). Lower household income and lack of college degree were associated with lower cMPR, more interference from adherence barriers, and decreased self-efficacy, as well as with increased depressive and anxiety symptoms. Similar associations, but less consistent, were observed for public health insurance. When stratified by age, associations between SES measures and adherence were most evident in adolescents, followed by adults, but absent in young adults, bringing into focus challenges with measuring SES in the 18-25 years age group.Conclusion: Lower SES is associated with worse medication adherence, more interference from adherence barriers, and lower self-efficacy.

"The Dutch Gastrointestinal Symptom Tracker for People With Cystic Fibrosis: Associations With Anxiety, Depression, and Health-Related Quality of Life.","Background: People with CF (pwCF) frequently have gastrointestinal symptoms (GI), including abdominal pain and irregular bowel movements. These are often embarrassing, difficult to report, and frequently missed. Thus, a GI Symptom Tracker was created and validated in the USA and translated and validated in Dutch. This questionnaire consists of four subscales: Eating Challenges, Stools, Adherence Challenges, and Abdominal Symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between GI symptoms, anxiety/depression, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Dutch pwCF.Methods: In this prospective, cross-sectional single-center pilot study, pwCF completed the Dutch GI Symptom Tracker, GAD-7 (anxiety), PHQ-9 (depression), and CFQ-R (HRQoL) from September 2021 to June 2022. Regression analyses were used to analyze the univariable associations between GI symptoms, anxiety/depression, and HRQoL.Results: A total of 51 pwCF were enrolled consecutively (n = 41 adults, 66% female, mean age (y) [range] = 32.7 [19-71] and n = 10 adolescents, 70% female, mean age (y) [range] = 14.2 [12-17]). Elevated levels of anxiety (scores ≥ 10 on GAD-7) were found in 17% of adults and 0% of adolescents. Elevated depression scores (≥ 10 on PHQ-9) were found in 9% of adults and 20% of adolescents. GI scales ""Abdominal Symptoms"" and ""Stools"" were significantly, positively associated with elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression. Most GI scales were associated with lower HRQoL.Conclusion: This is the first study investigating the link between GI symptoms assessed by the Dutch GI Symptom Tracker and anxiety/depression and HRQoL in Dutch pwCF. More GI symptoms were associated with higher anxiety and depression scores and worse HRQoL. Additional research is needed to better understand how mental and physical health are linked in GI symptoms in CF.",40019138,PMC11869532,10.1002/ppul.71021,,2025,"Verkleij M, Vlieg-Boerstra B, Hofsteenge GH, Haarman E, Twisk J, Quittner AL, de Meij T.",Y,MED
Highly Effective Modulator Therapy: Implications for the Microbial Landscape in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel. In the lungs specifically, CFTR mutations lead to changes in mucus viscosity and defective mucociliary clearance. Moreover, people with CF (pwCF) mount an insufficient immune response to invading pathogens, which predisposes individuals to chronic airway disease associated with chronic inflammation, colonization, and recurrent infections by mainly opportunistic pathogens. These chronic infections in the CF lung are typically polymicrobial and frequently harbour multidrug-resistant pathogens, making both treatment and eradication very challenging. During the last decade, the development of highly effective CFTR modulator therapy (HEMT) has led to a breakthrough in treatment options for pwCF. While the majority of pwCF now live longer and have fewer CF exacerbations, colonisation with common respiratory pathogens persists, thereby contributing to chronic inflammation and infection. Interestingly, there are limited reports examining the lung microbiome in the post-modulator era. Since ETI treatment is still quite novel and has only been used for about five years by now, this review will be one of the first discussing the current literature on the effect of ETI on CF pathogens. In addition, we will identify unanswered questions that remain from the effect of HEMT on the CF microbiome.",39595943,PMC11594123,10.3390/ijms252211865,,2024,"Valladares KN, Jones LI, Barnes JW, Krick S.",Y,MED
"Development and Validation of a New LC-MS/MS Method for Simultaneous Quantification of Ivacaftor, Tezacaftor and Elexacaftor Plasma Levels in Pediatric Cystic Fibrosis Patients.","**Background**: ""CFTR modulators"" (also named ""caftor"") have been developed and introduced into clinical practice to improve the functionality of defective CFTR protein. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is not currently used for CFTR modulators in routine clinical practice and there is still much to learn about the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and the safety profiles of these drugs in a real-world setting. Moreover, therapeutic ranges are not yet available for both pediatric and adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. **Methods**: A new and sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for contemporary quantification of ivacaftor (IVA), tezacaftor (TEZ) and elexacaftor (ELX) in plasma samples has been developed and validated. The clinical performance of our method has been tested on samples collected during the routine clinical practice from n = 25 pediatric patients (aged between 7 and 17 years) affected by cystic fibrosis. This LC-MS/MS method has been validated according to ICH (International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use) guidelines for the validation of bioanalytical methods. **Results**: Our method fulfilled ICH guidelines in terms of accuracy, precision, selectivity, specificity and carry-over. Intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision were ≤15%. The 9-day autosampler stability was 90-100% for TEZ and ELX; meanwhile, it fell to 76% for IVA. An injection volume of 1 µL and a wider quantification range (0.1-20 µg/mL) represent a novelty of our method in terms of sensitivity and fields of application. Finally, the evaluation of PK exposure parameters for IVA revealed strong agreement with previously published reports and with results from the summary of product characteristics (SmPCs). **Conclusions**: This method could be adopted to contemporarily measure ELX/TEZ/IVA plasma levels for both PK studies and monitor therapy compliance, especially in case of poor or partial responses to treatment, or to evaluate drug-drug interactions when multiple concomitant medications are required. Considering also the high cost burden of these medications to the health system, a TDM-based approach could facilitate more cost-effective patient management.",40732316,PMC12298270,10.3390/ph18071028,,2025,"Mancini A, Simeoli R, Cristiani L, Cairoli S, Ciciriello F, Boni A, Alghisi F, Rossi C, Antonetti G, Vici CD, Fiocchi AG, Cutrera R, Goffredo BM.",Y,MED
"Vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor for children aged 6-11 years with cystic fibrosis (RIDGELINE Trial VX21-121-105): an analysis from a single-arm, phase 3 trial.","Background: In phase 2 trials in people with cystic fibrosis aged 18 years and older, vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor has been shown to be a safe and effective, once-daily cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator. Restoring normal CFTR function early in life has the potential to prevent manifestations of cystic fibrosis. We aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor in children with cystic fibrosis aged 6-11 years.Methods: In this multicentre, single-arm, phase 3 trial (RIDGELINE Trial VX21-121-105), participants were enrolled across 33 clinical sites that care for children with cystic fibrosis in eight countries (Australia, France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA). Eligible participants were aged 6-11 years with at least one elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor-responsive CFTR variant, FEV1 % predicted of 60% or higher, and stable cystic fibrosis as determined by investigators. Before study treatment, participants were either on stable elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor for at least 28 days before screening or received the combination for a 4-week run-in period. Participants then received vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor (<40 kg bodyweight: vanzacaftor 12 mg, tezacaftor 60 mg, and deutivacaftor 150 mg orally as three fixed-dose combination tablets once daily; ≥40 kg bodyweight: vanzacaftor 20 mg, tezacaftor 100 mg, and deutivacaftor 250 mg orally as two fixed-dose combination tablets once daily (manufactured by Patheon Pharmaceuticals, Cincinnati, OH, USA) from day 1 for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability, as measured by adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory values, electrocardiograms, and pulse oximetry. Endpoints were analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05422222, and evaluation of the 6-11-year-old cohort is complete.Findings: Between Feb 6 and May 18, 2023, 83 children were screened, of whom five were not eligible, and 78 children aged 6-11 years received at least one dose of vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor. Median age was 9·3 years (IQR 7·6-10·4), 34 (44%) of 78 participants were female, 44 (56%) were male, 71 (91%) were White, one (1%) was Black or African American, and one (1%) was of multiple races. The analysis for these data was completed on Dec 15, 2023. Median exposure of participants to vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor was 168 days (IQR 166-170). 75 (96%) of 78 participants had adverse events, all of which were mild or moderate; the most common events were generally consistent with cystic fibrosis manifestations, including, cough (36 [46%]), pyrexia (16 [21%]), headache (14 [18%]), infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (13 [17%]), and oropharyngeal pain (13 [17%]). Serious adverse events occurred in six (8%) participants (two had infective pulmonary exacerbation, one of whom also had failure to thrive; one participant each had adenovirus infection, constipation, pulmonary function test decreased, and cough), and one (1%) participant discontinued due to adverse events of cough and fatigue that were considered possibly related to study drug.Interpretation: Vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor was safe and well tolerated and maintained FEV1 % predicted from elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor baseline with further improved CFTR function. Improvements in CFTR function compared with baseline elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor values demonstrate the potential opportunity to restore normal physiology early and prevent development or progression of cystic fibrosis. Nearly all participants had sweat chloride below the diagnostic threshold for cytstic fibrosis (<60 mmol/L) and more than half had normal levels (<30 mmol/L). Additional long-term data in children with cystic fibrosis are being collected in an open-label extension study to demonstrate clinical benefits and safety.

Gene expression responses of CF airway epithelial cells exposed to elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor suggest benefits beyond improved CFTR channel function.,"The combination of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI, Trikafta) reverses the primary defect in cystic fibrosis (CF) by improving CFTR-mediated Cl- and HCO3- secretion by airway epithelial cells (AECs), leading to improved lung function and less frequent exacerbations and hospitalizations. However, studies have shown that CFTR modulators like ivacaftor, a component of ETI, have numerous effects on CF cells beyond improved CFTR channel function. Because little is known about the effect of ETI on CF AEC gene expression, we exposed primary human AEC to ETI for 48 h and interrogated the transcriptome by RNA-seq and qPCR. ETI increased CFTR Cl- secretion, and defensin gene expression (*DEFB1*), an observation consistent with reports of decreased bacterial burden in the lungs of people with CF (pwCF). ETI decreased *MMP10* and *MMP12* gene expression, suggesting that ETI may reduce proteolytic-induced lung destruction in CF. ETI also reduced the expression of the stress response gene heme oxygenase (*HMOX1*). qPCR analysis confirmed *DEFB1*, *HMOX1*, *MMP10*, and *MMP12* gene expression results observed by RNA-seq. Gene pathway analysis revealed that ETI decreased inflammatory signaling, cellular proliferation, and MHC class II antigen presentation. Collectively, these findings suggest that the clinical observation that ETI reduces lung infections in pwCF is related in part to drug-induced increases in *DEFB1* and that ETI may reduce lung damage by reducing *MMP10* and *MMP12* gene expression. Moreover, pathway analysis also identified several other genes responsible for the ETI-induced reduction in inflammation observed in pwCF.**NEW & NOTEWORTHY** Gene expression responses by CF AECs exposed to ETI suggest that in addition to improving CFTR channel function, ETI is likely to enhance resistance to bacterial infection by increasing levels of beta-defensin 1 (hBD-1). ETI may also reduce lung damage by suppressing MMP10 and MMP12 and reduce airway inflammation by repressing proinflammatory cytokine secretion by CF AECs.",39437760,PMC11684945,10.1152/ajplung.00272.2024,,2024,"Hampton TH, Barnaby R, Roche C, Nymon A, Fukutani KF, MacKenzie TA, Charpentier LA, Stanton BA.",Y,MED
The long-term effect of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor on cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescent patients with cystic fibrosis: a pilot observational study.,"Background: Physical activity is a crucial demand on cystic fibrosis treatment management. The highest value of oxygen uptake (VO2peak) is an appropriate tool to evaluate the physical activity in these patients. However, there are several other valuable CPET parameters describing exercise tolerance (Wpeak, VO2VT1, VO2VT2, VO2/HRpeak, etc.), and helping to better understand the effect of specific treatment (VE, VT, VD/VT etc.). Limited data showed ambiguous results of this improvement after CFTR modulator treatment. Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor medication improves pulmonary function and quality of life, whereas its effect on CPET has yet to be sufficiently demonstrated.Methods: We performed a single group prospective observational study of 10 adolescent patients with cystic fibrosis who completed two CPET measurements between January 2019 and February 2023. During this period, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor treatment was initiated in all of them. The first CPET at the baseline was followed by controlled CPET at least one year after medication commencement. We focused on interpreting the data on their influence by the novel therapy. We hypothesized improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness following treatment. We applied the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The data were adjusted for age at the time of CPET to eliminate bias of aging in adolescent patients.Results: We observed significant improvement in peak workload, VO2 peak, VO2VT1, VO2VT2, VE/VCO2 slope, VE, VT, RQ, VO2/HR peak and RR peak. The mean change in VO2 peak was 5.7 mL/kg/min, or 15.9% of the reference value (SD ± 16.6; p= 0.014). VO2VT1 improved by 15% of the reference value (SD ± 0.1; p= 0.014), VO2VT2 improved by 0.5 (SD ± 0.4; p= 0.01). There were no differences in other parameters.Conclusion: Exercise tolerance improved after elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor treatment initiation. We suggest that the CFTR modulator alone is not enough for recovering physical decondition, but should be supplemented with physical activity and respiratory physiotherapy. Further studies are needed to examine the effect of CFTR modulators and physical therapy on cardiopulmonary exercise tolerance.",38807122,PMC11134686,10.1186/s12890-024-03069-8,,2024,"Stastna N, Hrabovska L, Homolka P, Homola L, Svoboda M, Brat K, Fila L.",Y,MED
Antibiotic treatment of bacterial lung infections in cystic fibrosis.,"Bacterial infections of the lower airways are the main cause of mortality and morbidity in cystic fibrosis. The most frequently isolated pathogens are S. aureus and P. aeruginosa; bacterial co-infections are frequently observed. The aim of this review is to provide, in the current context, the indications regarding the best antibiotic strategy to adopt in subjects affected by CF infected with the most common pathogens. We selected relevant publications (guidelines, systematic reviews and clinical studies published so far on these topics) and we analysed the sampling methods used and antibiotic strategies adopted. Oropharyngeal sampling methods are considered less sensitive for pathogen detection than sputum. In non-expectorating people, induced sputum is considered equivalent to two-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage, which is considered invasive. Antibiotic treatment against the main pathogens can consist in eradication treatment in the early stages of infection, chronic suppressive therapy and treatment of the pulmonary exacerbations. This scheme is valid for P. aeruginosa but remains to be demonstrated for the other pathogens. For S. aureus, no evidence-based therapeutic strategies on how to treat the different stages of bacterial infection have been established with certainty. With regard to the treatment of the other classic pathogens (B. cepacia complex, A. xylosoxidans and S. maltophilia), no evidence-based indications exist and decision is left to the clinician. The recent introduction of highly effective modulators on the CFTR protein, in addition to the favourable effects described in regulatory trials, has led to a reduction in bacterial isolations; the real effect of which in clinical practice has still to be assessed on the basis of scientific data. CONCLUSIONS: The reliability of culture examination depends on sampling methods, and expectorated sputum continues to be the best method as it is simple and non-invasive. P. aeruginosa is the pathogen for which antibiotic strategies for the various stages of infection appear best established, and the efficacy of early eradication treatment and chronic suppressive therapy have been underlined in clinical trials and systematic reviews. The recent introduction of modulators into clinical practice, despite their widely described efficacy, has not yet led to suggestions for changes in antibiotic strategies against the pathogens most frequently isolated.",39672981,PMC11645307,10.1007/s00431-024-05905-9,,2024,"Taccetti G, Terlizzi V, Campana S, Dolce D, Ravenni N, Fevola C, Francalanci M, Galici V, Neri AS.",Y,MED
"Pharmacological and pre-clinical safety profile of rSIV.F/HN, a hybrid lentiviral vector for cystic fibrosis gene therapy.","Rationale and objective: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CFTR modulators offer significant improvements, but ∼10% of patients remain nonresponsive or are intolerant. This study provides an analysis of rSIV.F/HN, a lentiviral vector optimised for lung delivery, including CFTR protein expression, functional correction of CFTR defects and genomic integration site analysis in preparation for a first-in-human clinical trial.Methods: Air-liquid interface cultures of primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) from CF patients (F508del/F508del), as well as a CFTR-deficient immortalised human lung epithelial cell line mimicking class I (CFTR-null) homozygous mutations, were used to assess transduction efficiency. Quantification methods included a novel proximity ligation assay for CFTR protein expression. For assessment of CFTR channel activity, Ussing chamber studies were conducted. The safety profile was assessed using integration site analysis and *in vitro* insertional mutagenesis studies.Results: rSIV.F/HN expressed CFTR and restored CFTR-mediated chloride currents to physiological levels in primary F508del/F508del HBECs as well as in a class I cells. In contrast, the latter could not be achieved by small-molecule CFTR modulators, underscoring the potential of gene therapy for this mutation class. Combination of rSIV.F/HN-CFTR with the potentiator ivacaftor showed a greater than additive effect. The genomic integration pattern showed no site predominance (frequency of occurrence ≤10%), and a low risk of insertional mutagenesis was observed in an *in vitro* immortalisation assay.Conclusions: The results underscore rSIV.F/HN as a promising gene therapy vector for CF, providing a mutation-agnostic treatment option.",39174284,PMC11780724,10.1183/13993003.01683-2023,,2025,"Moiseenko A, Sinadinos A, Sergijenko A, Pineault K, Saleh A, Nekola K, Strang N, Eleftheraki A, Boyd AC, Davies JC, Gill DR, Hyde SC, McLachlan G, Rath T, Rothe M, Schambach A, Hobbie S, Schuler M, Maier U, Thomas MJ, Mennerich D, Schmidt M, Griesenbach U, Alton EWFW, Kreuz S.",Y,MED
Lung Inflammatory Genes in Cystic Fibrosis and Their Relevance to Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Modulator Therapies.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic syndrome determined by over 2000 mutations in the *CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator* (*CFTR*) gene harbored on chromosome 7. In people with CF (PWCF), lung disease is the major determinant of morbidity and mortality and is characterized by a clinical phenotype which differs in the presence of equal mutational assets, indicating that genetic and environmental modifiers play an important role in this variability. Airway inflammation determines the pathophysiology of CF lung disease (CFLD) both at its onset and progression. In this narrative review, we aim to depict the inflammatory process in CF lung, with a particular emphasis on those genetic polymorphisms that could modify the clinical outcome of the respiratory disease in PWCF. The natural history of CF has been changed since the introduction of CFTR modulator therapies in the clinical arena. However, also in this case, there is a patient-to-patient variable response. We provide an overview on inflammatory/immunity gene variants that affect CFLD severity and an appraisal of the effects of CFTR modulator therapies on the inflammatory process in lung disease and how this knowledge may advance the optimization of the management of PWCF.",37895314,PMC10606852,10.3390/genes14101966,,2023,"Carbone A, Vitullo P, Di Gioia S, Conese M.",Y,MED
Cystic fibrosis and the clinical biofilm revolution A survey of the Danish CF Center's contribution.,"Biofilm infections are chronic infections which are difficult to diagnose. Biofilm infections are tolerant to antibiotics and the defense mechanisms of the host. Patients with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF) produce viscid mucus in the respiratory tract and therefore suffer from chronic biofilm infections in their lungs and paranasal sinuses. The most important microorganism is the mucoid phenotype of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* which causes chronic biofilm infections in the lungs of CF patients and untreated patients succumb as children if they contact this biofilm infection. Since CF patients are treated in CF Centers all over the world, it is possible to do longitudinal studies on epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of *P. aeruginosa* biofilm infection which is not possible if such patients are not followed in specialized centers. This survey describes the research through several decades in the Danish CF Center in Copenhagen which have changed the epidemiology, treatment, prophylaxis and prognosis of CF patients worldwide. Based on these results ESCMID Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of biofilm infections were published which have influenced biofilm research and treatment in other areas.",39811797,PMC11732244,10.1016/j.bioflm.2024.100246,,2025,Høiby N.,Y,MED

Pregnancy in People With Cystic Fibrosis Treated With Highly Effective Modulator Therapy.,"With improvements in overall health attributable to newly available medications called highly effective modulator therapy, an increasing number of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) are pursuing pregnancy. However, the safety of these medications for pregnant people with CF and the fetus remains largely unknown. Limited data demonstrate a decline in patients' health and well-being after withdrawal of highly effective modulator therapy during pregnancy; however, both animal and human studies suggest an association between highly effective modulator therapy and cataracts in the offspring that requires further investigation. Use of highly effective modulator therapy can also affect the results of newborn screening and may influence fetal outcomes among fetuses affected by CF as a result of transplacental passage of highly effective modulator therapy. An ongoing prospective cohort study will likely provide more information for pregnant people with CF. Until then, multidisciplinary counseling continues to be critical for people with CF who are of reproductive age.",39666984,PMC11630662,10.1097/aog.0000000000005732,,2025,"Goralski JL, Talati AN, Hardisty EE, Vora NL.",Y,MED

Management strategies for children with CF are primarily aimed at preventing lung damage and lung function decline caused by bacterial infections. The role of *Aspergillus* infections is less understood, especially during childhood, and therefore evidence-based diagnostic and treatment guidelines are lacking.

Changes in vitamins and trace elements after initiation of highly effective CFTR modulator therapy in children and adults with cystic fibrosis - a real-life insight.,"Background: Highly-effective CFTR-modulator therapy with elexa-/teza-/ivacaftor (ETI) has led to improvements in pulmonary outcomes, sweat chloride, body mass index (BMI) and quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Improved uptake of fat-soluble vitamins and micronutrients has been reported for CFTR-modulators but data regarding ETI therapy is lacking.Methods: This single-center retrospective study evaluated forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV-1), sweat chloride, BMI, transaminases (AST, ALT), bilirubin, vitamins A, D, E, zinc and selenium in children and adults eligible for ETI. Parameters were assessed before and up to one year after initiation of ETI.Results: 58 patients (median age m = 28 years, SD ± 11.6 years, 51.7% female14 < 18 years old) were included. FEV-1 and sweat chloride improved significantly after ETI. There were no changes in BMI or AST. ALT was increased significantly after 4 weeks of ETI but returned to normal levels in further course. Bilirubin levels remained elevated after ETI. Vitamin A was significantly higher 12 months after ETI. No changes were found for vitamins D, E, zinc and selenium.Conclusions: This study adds to the evidence that improvements of some fat-soluble vitamin levels can be found after ETI. No changes regarding micronutrients were noted.

In-depth analysis of cystic fibrosis cases caused by *CFTR* gene variation and research on the prediction and simulation of the impact on protein function.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by *CFTR* gene mutations. Its diagnosis mainly depends on genetic and sweat chloride tests, but the complexity of these mutations challenges diagnosis.Methods: This paper reports a new case of a Chinese child with cough and wheezing, suspected of having CF. Trio whole-exome sequencing for the pedigree was carried out to detect *CFTR* gene mutations. Five tools, namely Mutation Taster, PolyPhen-2, SIFT, FATHMM, and PROVEAN, were used to predict the impacts of mutations on protein function. AlphaFold was employed to predict protein structures, and GROMACS software was used to conduct stability analysis through molecular dynamics simulations.Results: The child was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, plastic bronchitis, and acute asthmatic bronchitis, with a high suspicion of CF. Whole-exome sequencing revealed compound missense mutations in the *CFTR* gene: c.1408 (exon 11) G>A (p.V470M) and c.650 (exon 6) A>G (p.E217G), both of which were homozygous mutations. Parental genetic tests showed that the father was heterozygous for the mutations, and the mother was heterozygous at the c.650 (exon 6) A>G locus and homozygous at the c.1408 (exon 11) G>A locus. The results obtained by different prediction tools varied, and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that these mutations significantly affected the stability of the CFTR protein.Conclusion: Analysis of this new case using multiple tools and computational chemistry simulations helps to further understand the impacts of mutations on CFTR protein function and the disease, offering novel insights into the diagnosis, treatment, and genetic counseling of CF caused by the complex and diverse mutations of the *CFTR* gene.",40433478,PMC12106003,10.3389/fped.2025.1574919,,2025,"Shan Y, Zhu Z, Liu X, Chi L, Zhang J, Cheng L, Liu T.",Y,MED
Success Rates of Assisted Reproduction for Men With Cystic Fibrosis.,"Background: The vast majority of men with CF (mwCF) are infertile. Improvements in assisted reproductive technology (ART) have made it possible for these patients to become biological fathers.Methods: Data were examined for all male CF patients attending a large adult CF center over a 23-year period. Azoospermia was confirmed via laboratory analysis of semen and was defined as complete absence of sperm in the ejaculate. Outcome of surgical sperm retrieval (SSR) procedure, post SSR complications, success rate of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and embryo transfer and subsequent live births were evaluated.Results: Seventy-one mwCF with proven azoospermia were referred to fertility services over the study period. Mean (SD) percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) 67.86 ( ± 25.3), body mass index (BMI) 24.3 ( ± 3.7) kg/m2. Seventy (98.5%) of these men underwent and had successful SSR. 67/71 (94%) couples proceeded to have ICSI post SSR. 11 couples had failed egg fertilisation, implantation, or early miscarriage. 56/67 couples (84%) went on to have live births. To date 10/71 (14%) mwCF referred for fertility treatment have died. Mean ppFEV1 and BMI of mwCF who survived was higher than those who died; FEV1 72.8% ( ± 23.4) versus 38% ( ± 12.0) (p < 0.001), BMI 25.0 ( ± 3.5) kg/m2 versus 20.3 ( ± 2.2) kg/mg2 (p < 0.001).Conclusion: This is the largest study to investigate success rate of fertility treatment in mwCF and demonstrates that fertility treatment is successful in greater than 75% of patients referred.

Medication adherence to CFTR modulators in patients with cystic fibrosis: a systematic review.,"Background: In the last decade, a fundamental shift in the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) took place due to the introduction of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators. Adequate medication adherence is a prerequisite for their effectiveness, but little is known about adherence to CFTR modulators. We aimed to assess the extent of medication adherence to CFTR modulators in patients with CF and assess which characteristics are associated with adherence.Methods: A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was performed. Studies needed to report adherence to CFTR modulators. Main outcomes were: 1) level of medication adherence and 2) associations of demographic and/or clinical characteristics with adherence.Results: In total, 4082 articles were screened and 21 full-text papers were assessed for eligibility. Ultimately, seven studies were included. Most studies were retrospective and focused on adherence to ivacaftor or lumacaftor-ivacaftor with only one focusing on elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor. The majority used pharmacy refill data with adherence determined with the proportion of days covered (PDC) or the medication possession ratio (MPR). One study additionally used electronic monitoring and patient self-reported adherence. Adherence was 0.62-0.99 based on pharmacy data (PDC or MPR), 61% *via* electronic monitoring and 100% *via* self-report. Age <18 years appeared to be associated with good adherence, as was a higher lung function.Conclusions: Despite the wide variety of adherence methods used, adherence to CFTR modulators is suboptimal, based on objective measures such as pharmacy refill data or electronic monitoring. CFTR modulator adherence measurement and definitions requires more standardisation with a preference for objective and granular methods.",39142708,PMC11322823,10.1183/16000617.0060-2024,,2024,"Hansen CME, Breukelman AJ, van den Bemt PMLA, Zwitserloot AM, van Dijk L, van Boven JFM.",Y,MED
Paediatric Thoracic Imaging in Cystic Fibrosis in the Era of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Modulation.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common progressive life-shortening genetic conditions worldwide. Ground-breaking translational research has generated therapies that target the primary cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) defect, known as CFTR modulators. A crucial aspect of paediatric CF disease is the development and progression of irreversible respiratory disease in the absence of clinical symptoms. Accurate thoracic diagnostics have an important role to play in this regard. Chest radiographs are non-specific and insensitive in the context of subtle changes in early CF disease, with computed tomography (CT) providing increased sensitivity. Recent advancements in imaging hardware and software have allowed thoracic CTs to be acquired in paediatric patients at radiation doses approaching that of a chest radiograph. CFTR modulators slow the progression of CF, reduce the frequency of exacerbations and extend life expectancy. In conjunction with advances in CT imaging techniques, low-dose thorax CT will establish a central position in the routine care of children with CF. International guidelines regarding the choice of modality and timing of thoracic imaging in children with CF are lagging behind these rapid technological advances. The continued progress of personalised medicine in the form of CFTR modulators will promote the emergence of personalised radiological diagnostics.",38397368,PMC10888261,10.3390/children11020256,,2024,"O'Regan PW, Stevens NE, Logan N, Ryan DJ, Maher MM.",Y,MED
The impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cystic fibrosis undergoing CFTR channel modulators treatment: a literature review.,"Several risk factors for Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) disease have been highlighted in clinical evidence. Among the various risk factors are advanced age, metabolic illness such as diabetes, heart disease, and diseases of the respiratory system. Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a rare disease with autosomal recessive transmission, characterised by a lack of synthesis of the CFTR channel protein, and multi-organ clinical symptoms mainly affecting the respiratory tract with recurrent pulmonary exacerbations. In view of the pathophysiological mechanisms, CF disease should be in theory considered a risk factor for SARS-CoV2 or severe COVID-19. However, recent clinical evidence seems to point in the opposite direction, suggesting that CF could be a protective factor against severe COVID-19. Possibly, the lack of presence or function of the CFTR channel protein could be linked to the expression of the membrane glycoprotein ACE-2, a key enzyme for the endocellular penetration of SARS-CoV-2 and related to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, CFTR channel modulating agents could indirectly influence the expression of ACE-2, playing an important role in restoring the proper functioning of mucociliary clearance and the pulmonary microbiome in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, the authors attempt to shed light on these important associations of issues that are not yet fully elucidated.",37957647,PMC10644493,10.1186/s12931-023-02593-1,,2023,"Vitiello A, Sabbatucci M, Silenzi A, Capuano A, Rossi F, Zovi A, Blasi F, Rezza G.",Y,MED
Impact of lumacaftor/ivacaftor on the bacterial and fungal respiratory pathogens in cystic fibrosis: a prospective multicenter cohort study in Sweden.,"Background: A significant decline in pulmonary exacerbation rates has been reported in CF patients homozygous for F508del treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. However, it is still unclear whether this reduction reflects a diminished microbiological burden.Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of lumacaftor/ivacaftor on the bacterial and fungal burden.Design: The study is a prospective multicenter cohort study including 132 CF patients homozygous for F508del treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor.Methods: Clinical parameters as well as bacterial and fungal outcomes 1 year after initiation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor were compared to data from 2 years prior to initiation of the treatment. Changes in the slope of the outcomes before and after the onset of treatment were assessed.Results: Lung function measured as ppFEV1 (*p* < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) in adults (*p* < 0.001), and BMI *z*-score in children (*p* = 0.007) were improved after initiation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. In addition, the slope of the prevalence of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (*p* = 0.007) and *Stenotrophomonas maltophilia* (*p* < 0.001) shifted from positive to negative, that is, became less prevalent, 1 year after treatment, while the slope for *Candida albicans* (*p* = 0.009), *Penicillium* spp (*p* = 0.026), and *Scedosporium apiospermum* (*p* < 0.001) shifted from negative to positive.Conclusion: The current study showed a significant improvement in clinical parameters and a reduction of some of CF respiratory microorganisms 1 year after starting with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. However, no significant changes were observed for *Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus*, or *Aspergillus fumigatus*, key pathogens in the CF context.",38780228,PMC11119492,10.1177/17534666241254090,,2024,"Al Shakirchi M, Sorjonen K, Hjelte L, Klingspor L, Bergman P, Ericson P, Svedberg M, Lindberg U, Hansen C, Monestrol I.",Y,MED
Changing profile of bacterial infection and microbiome in cystic fibrosis: when to use antibiotics in the era of CFTR-modulator therapy.,"The advent of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy, especially the triple therapy combining the drugs elexacaftor, tezacaftor, ivacaftor (ETI), has significantly changed the course of the disease in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). ETI, which is approved for the majority (80-90%) of pwCF, partially restores CFTR channel function, resulting in improved mucociliary clearance and, consequently, improved lung function, respiratory symptoms and pulmonary exacerbations. The bacterial burden of classical CF pathogens such as *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Staphylococcus aureus* is reduced without reaching eradication in the majority of infected patients. Limited data is available on less common or emerging bacterial pathogens. ETI has a positive effect on the lung microbiome but does not fully restore it to a healthy state. Due to the significant reduction in sputum production under ETI, respiratory samples such as deep-throat swabs are commonly taken, despite their inadequate representation of lower respiratory tract pathogens. Currently, there are still unanswered questions related to this new therapy, such as the clinical impact of infection with cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogens, the value of molecular diagnostic tests, the durability of the effects on respiratory infection and the role of fungal and viral infections. This article reviews the changes in bacterial lung infections and the microbiome in CF to provide evidence for the use of antibiotics in the era of ETI.",39631927,PMC11615665,10.1183/16000617.0068-2024,,2024,"Milczewska J, Syunyaeva Z, Żabińska-Jaroń A, Sands D, Thee S.",Y,MED
Nutritional impact of CFTR modulators in children with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Nutritional status is a major prognostic factor for breathing and the survival of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Since 2012, the development of CFTR modulators has considerably transformed the outcome of this disease. Indeed, both lung function and body mass index are improved by CFTR modulators, such as Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor. However, few data exist regarding the outcome of nutritional intakes under Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor.Methods: We conducted a prospective single-center study in children with CF treated with Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor to evaluate their nutritional intake before and after treatment.Results: Thirty-four children were included in this study, with a median age of 12.4 years [11.9; 14.7]. There was no significant improvement in weight, height or BMI. Patients' total energy intake was not significantly changed with Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor, while carbohydrate intakes decreased significantly. We found that blood levels of vitamin E and Selenium were significantly increased under Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor, without a significant increase in supplementation. In patients with a BMI Z-score < 0 at treatment initiation, there was a significant improvement in weight and BMI Z-score, while TEI and carbohydrate intakes were significantly lower.Conclusion: We showed that treatment with Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor improved the nutritional status of patients without necessarily being associated with an increase in nutritional intake. Although these data need to be confirmed in larger cohorts, they support the hypothesis that weight gain under modulators is multifactorial, and may be related to a decrease in energy expenditure or an improvement in absorption.",37063653,PMC10091219,10.3389/fped.2023.1130790,,2023,"Gaschignard M, Beaufils F, Lussac-Sorton F, Gallet P, Clouzeau H, Menard J, Costanzo A, Nouard L, Delhaes L, Tetard C, Lamireau T, Fayon M, Bui S, Enaud R.",Y,MED
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis as an initial manifestation of cystic fibrosis: Diagnostic and therapeutic implications in the era of CFTR modulators.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) results from complex hypersensitivity reactions to *Aspergillus fumigatus*, which often occur in patients with asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), or CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-related disorders. Genetic predisposition, particularly variants of the *CFTR* gene, probably plays a significant role in the development of ABPA. We present the case of a 20-year-old male with ABPA and bronchiectasis that was initially misdiagnosed as a result of normal sweat chloride values and negative first-level genetic testing results. Comprehensive *CFTR* gene sequencing revealed 2 pathogenic variants, R347H and D1152H, which together with the clinical phenotype and functional tests, supported the diagnosis of CF. Treatment with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor resulted in significant clinical and functional improvement, including a marked decrease in total IgE levels, suggesting a potential role for CFTR modulators in controlling ABPA. This case illustrates the evolving understanding of CF as a spectrum of disorders in which CFTR dysfunction may manifest subtly and variably, necessitating a high index of suspicion and a comprehensive diagnostic approach to ensure timely treatment in the era of highly effective CFTR modulators.",39131200,PMC11314417,10.1016/j.jacig.2024.100294,,2024,"Mitropoulou G, Balmpouzis Z, Oberhansli-Wavre A, Morris M, Blanchon S, Sauty A, Koutsokera A.",Y,MED
Efficacy and safety profile of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor triple therapy on cystic fibrosis: a systematic review and single arm meta-analysis.,"**Background:** Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor (ELE/TEZ/IVA) is believed to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF), but the exact efficacy and safety profile are still unknown. **Objective:** This study aimed to clarify the extent of functional restoration when patients are given with triple combination treatment and demonstrate the prevalence of adverse events, to evaluate the overall profile of ELE/TEZ/IVA on CF. **Methods:** A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library. Random effects single-arm meta-analysis was performed to decipher the basal characteristics of CF, the improvement and safety profile after ELE/TEZ/IVA treatment. **Results:** A total 53 studies were included in this analysis. For all the patients in included studies. 4 weeks after ELE/TEZ/IVA treatment, the increasement of percentage of predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (ppFEV1) was 9.23% (95%CI, 7.77%-10.70%), the change of percentage of predicted Forced Vital Capacity (ppFVC) was 7.67% (95%CI, 2.15%-13.20%), and the absolute change of Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) score was 21.46 points (95%CI, 18.26-24.67 points). The Sweat chloride (SwCl) was significantly decreased with the absolute change of -41.82 mmol/L (95%CI, -44.38 to -39.25 mmol/L). 24 weeks after treatment, the increasement of ppFEV1 was 12.57% (95%CI, 11.24%-13.90%), the increasement of ppFVC was 10.44% (95%CI, 7.26%-13.63%), and the absolute change of CFQ-R score was 19.29 points (95%CI, 17.19-21.39 points). The SwCl was significantly decreased with the absolute change of -51.53 mmol/L (95%CI, -56.12 to -46.94 mmol/L). The lung clearance index2.5 (LCI2.5) was also decreased by 1.74 units (95%CI, -2.42 to -1.07 units). The body mass index increased by 1.23 kg/m2 (95%CI, 0.89-1.57 kg/m2). As for adverse events, 0.824 (95%CI, 0.769-0.879) occurred during ELE/TEZ/IVA period, while the incidence of severe adverse events was 0.066 (95%CI, 0.028-0.104). **Conclusion:** ELE/TEZ/IVA is a highly effective strategy and relatively safe for CF patients and needs to be sustained to achieve better efficacy. **Systematic Review Registration:** Identifier: CRD42023441840.",38186649,PMC10768559,10.3389/fphar.2023.1275470,,2023,"Xu W, Wu T, Zhou Z, Zuo Z.",Y,MED
Current and future therapeutic approaches of CFTR and airway dysbiosis in an era of personalized medicine.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. This leads to a defective protein that impairs chloride transport, resulting in thick mucus buildup and chronic inflammation in the airways. The review discusses current and future therapeutic approaches for CFTR dysfunction and airway dysbiosis in the era of personalized medicine. Personalized medicine has revolutionized CF treatment with the advent of CFTR modulator therapies that target specific genetic mutations. These therapies have significantly improved patient outcomes, slowing disease progression, and enhancing quality of life. It also highlights the growing recognition of the airway microbiome's role in CF pathogenesis and discusses strategies to modulate the microbiome to further improve patient outcomes. This review discusses various therapeutic approaches for cystic fibrosis (CFTR) mutations, including adenovirus gene treatments, nonviral vectors, CRISPR/cas9 methods, RNA replacement, antisense-oligonucleotide-mediated DNA-based therapies, and cell-based therapies. It also introduces airway dysbiosis with CF and how microbes influence the lungs. The review highlights the importance of understanding the cellular and molecular causes of CF and the development of personalized medicine to improve quality of life and health outcomes.",39027867,PMC11254065,10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1085_23,,2024,"Upadhyay K, Nigam N, Gupta S, Tripathi SK, Jain A, Puri B.",Y,MED
Comparison of Reporting Quality in National Cystic Fibrosis Patient Registries: Implications for Identifying Use of Novel CFTR Modulators.,"Introduction: Advances in development of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator (CFTRm) therapies mean that now people who are heterozygous (instead of having to be homozygous) for the common F508del variant can benefit from these therapies. Recent economic estimates suggest only approximately 15% of the global population have CFTRm access, yet it is unknown how prevalence of F508del and economic factors may affect this availability.Methods: Data related to prevalence of cystic fibrosis (CF), CFTRm usage, and prevalence of F508del in 10 countries were extracted from publicly accessible registry reports from 2021. National gross domestic product (GDP) was obtained via open access World Bank data. Descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients assessed relationships.Results: Notable discrepancies were noted in the equity of availability of data between national registries-only four countries reported number of patients eligible for CFTRm. Registry data represented 70,694 patients, with 42,858 found to be using CFTRm (60.6%). Prevalence of CFTRm usage ranged from 1.8% to 76.7% and prevalence of F508del ranged from 35.2% to 94.4%. The correlation between prevalence of CFTRm usage and F508del is positive (r = 0.56, p = 0.10), and the correlation between CFTRm usage and GDP (per capita) was also positive, and significant (r = 0.72, p = 0.02).Conclusion: Both F508del prevalence and GDP are associated with variable CFTRm usage rates, although a predominant reason is unclear as a result of poor consistency in registry reporting. Urgent action is needed to create uniform reporting of registry data and increase availability of novel CFTRm therapies to the global CF population.",39333383,PMC11574223,10.1007/s41030-024-00274-y,,2024,"Tomlinson OW, Mitchelmore P, Williams CA.",Y,MED
Human-based complex *in vitro* models: their promise and potential for rare disease therapeutics.,"Rare diseases affect a small percentage of an individual country's population; however, with over 7,000 in total, rare diseases represent a significant disease burden impacting up to 10% of the world's population. Despite this, there are no approved treatments for almost 95% of rare diseases, and the existing treatments are cost-intensive for the patients. More than 70% of rare diseases are genetic in nature, with patient-specific mutations. This calls for the need to have personalised and patient-specific preclinical models that can lead to effective, speedy, and affordable therapeutic options. Complex *in vitro* models (CIVMs), including those using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), organoids, and organs-on-chips are emerging as powerful human-based pre-clinical systems with the capacity to provide efficacy data enabling drugs to move into clinical trials. In this narrative review, we discuss how CIVMs are providing insights into biomedical research on rare diseases. We also discuss how these systems are being used in clinical trials to develop efficacy models for rare diseases. Finally, we propose recommendations on how human relevant CIVMs could be leveraged to increase translatability of basic, applied and nonclinical research outcomes in the field of rare disease therapeutics in developed as well as middle-and low-income countries.",39931243,PMC11807990,10.3389/fcell.2025.1526306,,2025,"Parvatam S, Pistollato F, Marshall LJ, Furtmann F, Jahagirdar D, Chakraborty Choudhury M, Mohanty S, Mittal H, Meganathan S, Mishra R.",Y,MED
Impact of Gene Modifiers on Cystic Fibrosis Phenotypic Profiles: A Systematic Review.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex monogenic disorder with a large variability in disease severity. Growing evidence suggests that the variation observed depends not only on variations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene but also on modifier genes. Utilizing five databases (including CINAHL, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science), a systematic review was conducted to examine the current literature on the known impacts of genomic variations in modifier genes on the CF disease progression, severity, and therapeutic response. A total of 70 full-text articles describing over 80 gene modifiers associated with CF were selected. The modifier genes included genes associated with the CFTR interactome, the inflammatory response, microbial profiles, and other genes affecting the critical physiological pathways of multiple organ systems, such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Limitations of the existing literature embrace the lack of clinical studies investigating pharmacogenetic impacts and the significance of gene modifiers on the CF clinical picture, including a limited number of replication and validation studies. Further investigations into other potential gene modifiers using genome-wide association studies are needed to critically explore new therapeutic targets and provide a better understanding of the CF disease phenotype under specific drug treatments.",40225935,PMC11919198,10.1155/2024/6165547,,2024,"Ward A, Mauleon R, Ooi CY, Rosic N.",Y,MED
Blood platelet reduction after elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor treatment in people with cystic fibrosis may depend on systemic inflammation reduction.,"The elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) combination for cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator modulators is a safe and effective treatment in both adults and children who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for the F508del variant. However, few cases involving a significant reduction in blood platelets and an increase in the alanine aminotransferase/platelet ratio have been described in adult and pediatric patients receiving ETI therapy. In the present study, we describe 272 people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) (166 adult and 106 pediatric pwCF) who were independently followed at two centers; moreover, these individuals were homozygous or compound heterozygous for the F508del variant, were treated with ETI for at least one year, and exhibited monitored platelet and leukocyte counts (together with liver and inflammatory biochemical indices). As controls, 272 healthy subjects (HCs) matched for sex and age were evaluated. At baseline, both adult and pediatric pwCF demonstrated significantly (p < 0.01) greater blood platelet and leukocyte counts compared with HCs. One year of treatment significantly reduced blood platelet counts (adults: 248*103/mmc vs. 288*103/mmc, p < 0.01; children: 283*103/mmc vs. 320*103/mmc, p < 0.01) and leukocyte counts (adults: 6.5*103/mmc vs. 7.6*103/mmc, p < 0.01; children: 6.8*103/mmc vs. 7.9*103/mmc, p < 0.01). In addition, the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level was significantly (p < 0.01) decreased after therapy, whereas the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level and the ALT/platelet ratio were significantly increased (p < 0.01). After the second year of therapy, the laboratory parameters were not further altered in approximately half of the patients. The reduction in platelets was significantly correlated with a decrease in leukocytes (rs: 0.352, p < 0.001), serum CRP levels (rs: 0.392, p < 0.001) and exacerbations (oral antibiotic cycles, rs: 0.241, p = 0.002; intravenous antibiotic cycles, rs: 0.153, p = 0.049). These findings suggest that the normalization of platelets may be dependent on the reduction in systemic inflammation induced by ETI therapy.",40730841,PMC12307711,10.1038/s41598-025-12333-8,,2025,"Castaldo A, Cimbalo C, Fevola C, Carnovale V, Iacotucci P, Raia V, Terlizzi V, Gelzo M, Sepe A, Tosco A.",Y,MED
Neutrophil extracellular traps are associated with airways inflammation and increased severity of lung disease in cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterised by inflammatory lung disease and large numbers of airways neutrophils. In health, neutrophils undergo apoptosis and removal from the airway. Since CF neutrophils are known to engage in apoptosis less efficiently, we wanted to assess whether alternative forms of neutrophil clearance such as NETosis were prominent in the CF airway.Methods: Sputum and blood were collected from 45 CF and 15 healthy control (HC) participants. Neutrophil morphology and biochemical properties were assessed in CF and HC sputum. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were measured by a novel histone-calprotectin ELISA. NET levels were compared with established measurements of airway inflammation. CF participants were followed up for 1 year and the number of exacerbations recorded. Neutrophil and macrophage co-culture experiments were undertaken with cells from CF and HC.Results: Neutrophil numbers were significantly higher in CF and associated with abnormal morphology. Several inflammatory mediators were elevated in CF sputum, as was cell-free DNA. This was highly correlated with sputum calprotectin, a known NET-associated protein. Using a histone-calprotectin NET ELISA, we demonstrated higher levels of NETs in the CF airway. CF participants treated with DNase had fewer sputum NETs, and in neutrophil/macrophage co-culture experiments, DNase effectively attenuated the pro-inflammatory potential of NETs, suggesting a previously unrecognised anti-inflammatory role for this treatment.Conclusions: NETs in the CF airway are associated with increased levels of inflammatory mediators and more severe lung disease. NET effects on macrophages can be blocked by DNase, suggesting an anti-inflammatory role for this treatment in CF.",39624379,PMC11610045,10.1183/23120541.00312-2024,,2024,"Law SM, Hardisty G, Gillan JL, Robinson NJ, Davidson DJ, Whyte MKB, Dransfield I, Gray RD.",Y,MED
Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor influences body composition in adults with cystic fibrosis: a fully automated CT-based analysis.,"A poor nutritional status is associated with worse pulmonary function and survival in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators can improve pulmonary function and body weight, but more data is needed to evaluate its effects on body composition. In this retrospective study, a pre-trained deep-learning network was used to perform a fully automated body composition analysis on chest CTs from 66 adult pwCF before and after receiving elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) therapy. Muscle and adipose tissues were quantified and divided by bone volume to obtain body size-adjusted ratios. After receiving ETI therapy, marked increases were observed in all adipose tissue ratios among pwCF, including the total adipose tissue ratio (+ 46.21%, p < 0.001). In contrast, only small, but statistically significant increases of the muscle ratio were measured in the overall study population (+ 1.63%, p = 0.008). Study participants who were initially categorized as underweight experienced more pronounced effects on total adipose tissue ratio (p = 0.002), while gains in muscle ratio were equally distributed across BMI categories (p = 0.832). Our findings suggest that ETI therapy primarily affects adipose tissues, not muscle tissue, in adults with CF. These effects are primarily observed among pwCF who were initially underweight. Our findings may have implications for the future nutritional management of pwCF.",38658613,PMC11043331,10.1038/s41598-024-59622-2,,2024,"Westhölter D, Haubold J, Welsner M, Salhöfer L, Wienker J, Sutharsan S, Straßburg S, Taube C, Umutlu L, Schaarschmidt BM, Koitka S, Zensen S, Forsting M, Nensa F, Hosch R, Opitz M.",Y,MED

An Update in Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes in Children and Adolescents.,"This paper delineates several aspects of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD)-a common complication of cystic fibrosis (CF). CFRD exhibits a predilection for older individuals with CF, yet it also extends its influence on children and adolescents. Scientific insights postulate a potential link between CFRD and the aberrant mucus production within the pancreas, thereby culminating in pancreatic insufficiency. This, in turn, perturbs the synthesis of insulin, a pivotal endocrine hormone responsible for the regulation of glycemic levels. Standardized protocols advocate for the systematic screening of CFRD among all individuals with CF, commencing at the age of 10 years using the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Therapeutic modalities encompass insulin therapy, dietary adjustments, and the vigilant monitoring of glycemic parameters. The overarching objective is to maintain blood glucose levels within a targeted range to mitigate the advent of diabetic complications. Untreated or sub-optimally managed CFRD can precipitate a spectrum of deleterious health ramifications, encompassing cardiovascular afflictions, neuropathy, renal dysfunction, and ocular complications.",38136081,PMC10741586,10.3390/children10121879,,2023,"Anton-Păduraru DT, Murgu AM, Donos MA, Trofin F, Azoicăi AN, Popovici P, Stana AB, Gheorghiescu I, Trandafir LM.",Y,MED
Comprehensive Assessment of *CFTR* Modulators' Therapeutic Efficiency for N1303K Variant.,"p.Asn1303Lys (N1303K) is a common missense variant of the *CFTR* gene, causing cystic fibrosis (CF). In this study, we initially evaluated the influence of *CFTR* modulators on the restoration of N1303K-*CFTR* function using intestinal organoids derived from four CF patients expressing the N1303K variant. The forskolin-induced swelling assay in organoids offered valuable insights about the beneficial effects of VX-770 + VX-661 + VX-445 (Elexacaftor + Tezacaftor + Ivacaftor, ETI) on N1303K-*CFTR* function restoration and about discouraging the prescription of VX-770 + VX-809 (Ivacaftor + Lumacaftor) or VX-770 + VX-661 (Ivacaftor + Tezacaftor) therapy for N1303K/class I patients. Then, a comprehensive assessment was conducted on an example of one patient with the N1303K/class I genotype to examine the ETI effect on the restoration of N1303K-*CFTR* function using in vitro the patient's intestinal organoids, ex vivo the intestinal current measurements (ICM) method and assessment of the clinical status before and after targeted therapy. All obtained results are consistent with each other and have proven the effectiveness of ETI for the N1303K variant. ETI produced a significant positive effect on forskolin-induced swelling in N1303K/class I organoids indicating functional improvement of the *CFTR* protein; ICM demonstrated that ETI therapy restored *CFTR* function in the intestinal epithelium after three months of treatment, and the patient improved his clinical status and lung function, increased his body mass index (BMI) and reduced the lung pathogenic flora diversity, surprisingly without improving the sweat test results.",38474016,PMC10931982,10.3390/ijms25052770,,2024,"Efremova A, Kashirskaya N, Krasovskiy S, Melyanovskaya Y, Krasnova M, Mokrousova D, Bulatenko N, Kondratyeva E, Makhnach O, Bukharova T, Zinchenko R, Kutsev S, Goldshtein D.",Y,MED
Plasma levels of chemokines decrease during elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor therapy in adults with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with dysregulated immune responses, exaggerated inflammation and chronic infection. CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies directly target the underlying protein defects and resulted in significant clinical benefits for people with CF (pwCF). This study analysed the effects of triple CFTR modulator therapy elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) on CF-associated inflammation, especially systemic chemokines.Methods: A bead-based immunoassay was used to quantify proinflammatory chemokines (IL-8, IP-10, Eotaxin, TARC, RANTES, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MIP-3α, MIG, ENA-78, GROα, I-TAC) in plasma samples from pwCF collected before, at three, and at six months after starting ETI therapy.Results: Fifty-one pwCF (47 % female; mean age 32 ± 10.4 years) were included. At baseline, 67 % were already receiving CFTR modulator therapy with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or lumacaftor/ivacaftor. After initiation of ETI therapy there was a significant improvement in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (+12.7 points, p < 0.001) and a significant decrease in sweat chloride levels (-53.6 %, p < 0.001). After 6 months' treatment with ETI therapy there were significant decreases in plasma levels of MIP-3α (-68.2 %, p = 0.018), GROα (-17.7 %, p = 0.013), ENA-78 (-16.3 %, p = 0.034) and I-TAC (-3.4 %, p = 0.032). IL-8 exhibited a reduction that did not reach statistical significance (-17.8 %, p = 0.057); levels of other assessed cytokines did not change significantly from baseline.Conclusions: ETI appears to affect a distinct group of chemokines that are predominately associated with neutrophilic inflammation, demonstrating the anti-inflammatory properties of ETI therapy.",38173511,PMC10761561,10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e23428,,2024,"Westhölter D, Pipping J, Raspe J, Schmitz M, Sutharsan S, Straßburg S, Welsner M, Taube C, Reuter S.",Y,MED
Cystic Fibrosis: Understanding Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator Mutation Classification and Modulator Therapies.,"A common life-threatening hereditary disease, Cystic Fibrosis (CF), affects primarily Caucasian infants. High sweat-salt levels are observed as a result of a single autosomal mutation in chromosome 7 that affects the critical function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). For establishing tailored treatment strategies, it is important to understand the broad range of CFTR mutations and their impacts on disease pathophysiology. This study thoroughly investigates the six main classes of classification of CFTR mutations based on their functional effects. Each class is distinguished by distinct molecular flaws, such as poor protein synthesis, misfolding, gating defects, conduction defects, and decreased CFTR expression at the apical membrane. Furthermore, this paper focuses on the emerging field of CFTR modulators, which intend to restore CFTR function or mitigate its consequences. These modulators, which are characterized by the mode of action and targeted mutation class, have the potential to provide personalized therapy regimens in CF patients. This review provides valuable insights into the genetic basis of CF pathology, and highlights the potential for precision medicine methods in CF therapy by thoroughly investigating CFTR mutation classification and related modulators.",39051188,PMC11270331,10.3390/arm92040026,,2024,"Anwar S, Peng JL, Zahid KR, Zhou YM, Ali Q, Qiu CR.",Y,MED
Disparities and therapeutic advances in cystic fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) has seen a multitude of therapeutic advances targeting its downstream effects. This has led to a steady increase in survival over the past few decades. The recent development of disease-modifying drugs targeting the underlying CFTR mutation has revolutionized treatment for CF. Despite these advances, individuals with CF who are racial and ethnic minorities, from low socioeconomic status, or female sex have worse clinical outcomes. The inequitable access to CFTR modulators from cost and/or genetic eligibility has the potential to further worsen the existing health disparities seen within the CF community.",37133222,PMC11601024,10.1002/ppul.26445,,2024,Palla JB.,Y,MED
G-formula with multiple imputation for causal inference with incomplete data.,"G-formula is a popular approach for estimating the effects of time-varying treatments or exposures from longitudinal data. G-formula is typically implemented using Monte-Carlo simulation, with non-parametric bootstrapping used for inference. In longitudinal data settings missing data are a common issue, which are often handled using multiple imputation, but it is unclear how G-formula and multiple imputation should be combined. We show how G-formula can be implemented using Bayesian multiple imputation methods for synthetic data, and that by doing so, we can impute missing data and simulate the counterfactuals of interest within a single coherent approach. We describe how this can be achieved using standard multiple imputation software and explore its performance using a simulation study and an application from cystic fibrosis.",40165440,PMC12209542,10.1177/09622802251316971,,2025,"Bartlett JW, Olarte Parra C, Granger E, Keogh RH, van Zwet EW, Daniel RM.",Y,MED
How Effectively Can Oxidative Stress and Inflammation Be Reversed When CFTR Function Is Pharmacologically Improved?,"A critical challenge in the age of advanced modulator therapies is to understand and determine how effectively chronic oxidative stress and oxidative stress-induced inflammation can be reversed and physiological balance restored when CFTR function is pharmacologically improved. The triple therapy with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) suggests that CFTR activity in individuals with at least one F508del mutation can be partially restored to about 50% of normal levels. Although incomplete, the partial recovery of CFTR function has been shown to drastically lower sputum pathogen content, enhance microbiome diversity, and lower inflammation markers within the first year of treatment in adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis. However, despite these advancements, residual airway infection, oxidative stress and inflammation persist, with levels similar to other chronic lung conditions, like non-CF bronchiectasis. This persistence highlights the necessity for innovative antioxidant and anti-inflammatory treatments, in particular for individuals with advanced lung disease. To address this issue, emerging multi-omics technologies offer valuable tools to investigate the impact of modulator therapies on various molecular pathways. By analyzing changes in gene expression, epigenetic modifications, protein profiles and metabolic processes in airway-derived samples, it could be possible to uncover the mechanisms driving persistent oxidative stress and inflammation. These insights could pave the way for identifying new therapeutic targets to fully restore airway health and overall physiological balance.",40227282,PMC11939277,10.3390/antiox14030310,,2025,"Villella VR, Castaldo A, Scialò F, Castaldo G.",Y,MED
The Effect of Complex Alleles of the *CFTR* Gene on the Clinical Manifestations of Cystic Fibrosis and the Effectiveness of Targeted Therapy.,"The authors of this article analyzed the available literature with the results of studying the prevalence of complex alleles of the *CFTR* gene among patients with cystic fibrosis, and their pathogenicity and influence on targeted therapy with CFTR modulators. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystemic autosomal recessive disease caused by a defect in the expression of the CFTR protein, and more than 2000 genetic variants are known. Clinically significant variants are divided into seven classes. Information about the frequency of complex alleles appears in a number of registers, along with the traditional presentation of data on genetic variants. Complex alleles (those with the presence of more than two nucleotide variants on one allele) can complicate the diagnosis of the disease, and change the clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis and the response to treatment, since each variant in the complex allele can contribute to the functional activity of the CFTR protein, changing it both in terms of increasing and decreasing function. The role of complex alleles is often underestimated, and their frequency has not been studied. At the moment, characteristic frequently encountered complex alleles have been found for several populations of patients with cystic fibrosis, but the prevalence and pathogenicity of newly detected complex alleles require additional research. In this review, more than 35 complex alleles of the *CFTR* gene from existing research studies were analyzed, and an analysis of their influence on the manifestations of the disease and the effectiveness of CFTR modulators was also described.",38203285,PMC10779438,10.3390/ijms25010114,,2023,"Krasnova M, Efremova A, Bukhonin A, Zhekaite E, Bukharova T, Melyanovskaya Y, Goldshtein D, Kondratyeva E.",Y,MED
Pharmacological rescue of the G85E CFTR variant by preclinical and approved modulators.,"Introduction: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease due to loss-of-function mutations of the CFTR channel. F508del is the most frequent mutation (70% of alleles in Italy), while other mutations have much lower frequency. Among them, G85E (0.4% frequency globally, 1.13% in Italy) emerges as a mutation characterized by a severe CFTR folding and trafficking defect.Methods: To investigate the pharmacological responsiveness of the G85E-CFTR variant, we performed a functional and biochemical characterization in heterologous expression systems and *ex vivo* models based on patient-derived human nasal epithelial cells (HNEC).Results: Our study demonstrated that treatment of primary airway cells with elexacaftor and tezacaftor causes a significant (although modest) rescue of CFTR function, that reaches 15%-25% of the activity measured in non-CF epithelia. A detrimental effect of chronic treatment with ivacaftor, further limiting G85E rescue, was also observed. A higher rescue of CFTR function, up to 25%-35% of the normal CFTR activity, with no evidence of negative effects upon chronic potentiator treatment, can be achieved by combining elexacaftor with ARN23765, a novel type 1 corrector endowed with very high potency. Importantly, dose-response relationships suggest that G85E might alter the binding of type 1 correctors, possibly affecting their affinity for the target.Discussion: In conclusion, our studies suggest that novel combinations of modulators, endowed with higher efficacy leading to increased rescue of G85E-CFTR, are needed to improve the clinical benefit in patients for this variant.",39624835,PMC11608983,10.3389/fphar.2024.1494327,,2024,"Tomati V, Capurro V, Pesce E, Pastorino C, Sondo E, Lena M, Borrelli A, Cresta F, Pantano S, Collini F, Ripani P, Terlizzi V, Fevola C, Costa S, Lucanto MC, Zara F, Bandiera T, Bocciardi R, Castellani C, Galietta LJV, Pedemonte N.",Y,MED
Effect of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor on nasal potential difference and lung function in Phe508del rats.,"**Introduction:** *Phe508del* is the most common cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene variant that results in the recessive genetic disorder cystic fibrosis (CF). The recent development of highly effective CFTR modulator therapies has led to significant health improvements in individuals with this mutation. While numerous animal models of CF exist, few have a CFTR mutation that is amenable to the triple combination therapy elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI). **Methods:** To determine the responsiveness of *Phe508del* rats to ETI, a baseline nasal potential difference was measured. Subsequently, they received ETI daily for 14 days, after which post-treatment nasal potential difference, lung mechanics (via flexiVent) and lung ventilation (via X-ray Velocimetry) were assessed. **Results:** Chloride ion transport in nasal airways was restored in *Phe508del* rats treated with ETI, but neither lung mechanics nor ventilation were significantly altered. **Discussion:** These findings validate the usefulness of this rat model for future investigations of modulator therapy in CF.",38545546,PMC10965794,10.3389/fphar.2024.1362325,,2024,"Reyne N, Cmielewski P, McCarron A, Smith R, Schneider-Futschik E, Eikelis N, Pirakalathanan P, Parsons D, Donnelley M.",Y,MED
Efficacy of advanced hybrid closed loop systems in cystic fibrosis related diabetes: a pilot study.,"Background and aims: Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is correlated with worsening of nutritional status and greater deterioration of lung function. The role of new technologies for the treatment of CFRD is little explored. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop (AHCL) systems on glycemic control in CF patients.Methods: A single-center retrospective study on CFRD patients using AHCL systems was performed. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) metrics were collected at T0 (AHCL placement), T1 (1-month), T2 (6-months) and T3 (1-year) to evaluate glycemic control.Results: 10 patients were included in the study. Data showed a reduction of HbA1c value (7.31 ± 0.34 to 6.35 ± 1.00; p=0.03), glycemic variability (p=0.05) and insulin requirement (p=0.03). The study population reached American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended glycemic targets at 1-year. An increase in the Time in Range (TIR) and a reduction in time in hyperglycemia were also observed, although not statistically significant.Conclusions: In patients with CFRD, the use of AHCL leads to an improvement in glycemic control in terms of HbA1c and glycemic variability. The increase in TIR and the reduction of time in hyperglycemia, although not statistically significant, are extremely encouraging from a clinical point of view. Further studies with a larger population and a longer follow-up are needed. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of proposing the use of AHCL even in CF patients, who could benefit from glycemic improvement also in terms of nutritional status and respiratory function.",38966218,PMC11222316,10.3389/fendo.2024.1347141,,2024,"Bassi M, Franzone D, Dufour F, Spacco G, Cresta F, d'Annunzio G, Tantari G, Calevo MG, Castellani C, Minuto N, Casciaro R.",Y,MED
"Development and clinical implementation of an LC-HRMS method for ivacaftor, lumacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor in human plasma and breast milk.","The four cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators, ivacaftor, lumacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor, have revolutionised the treatment of CF by direct action on the protein target behind the disease's development. The aim was to develop and validate a quantification method for these CFTR modulators in plasma and breast milk to better understand inter-patient variability in pharmacokinetics and treatment outcome, including the risk of adverse drug reactions. The ability to monitor CFTR modulators in breast milk enables the estimation of the exposure of breastfed infant, with a potential concern for CFTR modulator-induced liver injury. The analysis was performed on a Thermo Vanquish Flex Binary UHPLC system coupled to a high-resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS), Thermo Q Exactive. The analytes were detected using positive electrospray ionisation in full scan mode. After sample preparation by protein precipitation, the supernatant was injected onto the LC system and the analytes were separated using a Zorbax SB-C18 Rapid Res HPLC column (3.5 µm, 4.6 × 75 mm). This is the first published method for CFTR modulators in breast milk. The validated quantification range for ivacaftor is 0.0050-10 µg/mL with a coefficient of variation < 6% and a mean accuracy of 97-106%; for lumacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor, the validated quantification range is 0.050-100 µg/mL with a coefficient of variation < 8% and a mean accuracy 93-106%.

Quantification of Enteric Dysfunction in Cystic Fibrosis: Inter- and Intraindividual Variability.,"Objectives: To test the utility of various biomarkers as indicators of gut dysfunction in cystic fibrosis (CF) and determine whether intraindividual variations in these measures are repeatable over short intervals and whether interindividual variations correlate with clinical outcomes.Study design: We performed a cross-sectional, limited longitudinal study of children with CF aged 1-21 years who provided blood and stool samples at 2 or 3 visits, 2 weeks and 3 months apart, which were assayed for markers of intestinal inflammation (fecal calprotectin [fCal], lipocalin-2 [fLcn2], neopterin), and permeability (plasma lipopolysaccharide [LPS] antibodies, LPS-binding protein) by enzyme immunoassays. Control specimens were obtained from children without CF who had undergone esophagogastroduodenoscopy and had no evidence of gut inflammation.Results: Twenty-six of 29 participants with CF completed the study. Sixty-nine stools (57 case/12 control) and 76 plasmas (60 case/16 control) were analyzed. LPS antibody had reliable intraindividual stability. fCal, fLcn2, and neopterin were significantly greater in CF than in control samples. fCal was negatively correlated with 3-month interval change (Δ) in weight-for-age z-score, body mass index/weight-for-length z-score, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second. fLcn2 was negatively correlated with FEV1 but not with anthropometrics. No marker correlated with Δbody mass index/weight-for-length z-score or ΔFEV1.Conclusions: fLcn2 is elevated in people with CF and might predict worse interval pulmonary function. Expanded studies are warranted to test if fLcn2 correlates with changes in additional outcomes.",37866678,PMC10869934,10.1016/j.jpeds.2023.113800,,2024,"Duckworth LA, Sutton KA, Shaikh N, Wang J, Hall-Moore C, Holtz LR, Tarr PI, Rubenstein RC.",Y,MED
Wound repair and immune function in the *Pseudomonas* infected CF lung: before and after highly effective modulator therapy.,"The leading cause of death for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) continues to be due to respiratory-related illnesses. Both wound repair and immune cell responses are dysregulated in the CF airways, creating a cycle of unresolved injury and perpetuating inflammation. PwCF are predisposed to colonization and infections with opportunistic bacteria like *Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa)*, the most common adult pathogen in CF. *Pa* possesses key virulence factors that can exacerbate chronic inflammation and lung injury. With the approval of highly effective modulator therapies like elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), pwCF eligible for ETI have seen drastic improvements in lung function and clinical outcomes, including an increased life expectancy. While modulator therapies are improving bronchial epithelial cellular processes in wound repair and some areas of immunity, many of these processes do not reach a non-CF baseline state or have not been thoroughly studied. The effect of modulator therapy on *Pa* may lead to a reduction in infection, but in more longitudinal studies, there is not always eradication of *Pa*, and colonization and infection frequency can return to pre-modulator levels over time. Finally, in this review we explore the current state of additional treatments for CF lung disease, independent of CFTR genotype, including anti-inflammatories, phage-therapies, and *Pa* vaccines.",40357395,PMC12066499,10.3389/fcimb.2025.1566495,,2025,"Matthews EL, Hirsch MJ, Prokopczuk F, Jones LI, Martínez E, Barnes JW, Krick S.",Y,MED
Nationwide lung function monitoring from infancy in newborn-screened children with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease starts in infancy and can be assessed for structural lung abnormalities using computed tomography or magnetic resonance scans, or for lung function impairment using multiple breath washout (MBW). However, in infancy these two methods are not well correlated. Trajectories of CF lung disease assessed by MBW in infants and toddlers remain poorly described, which is why we aimed to 1) describe the trajectory of lung function, 2) explore risk factors for progression and 3) explore the real-life effect of lumacaftor/ivacaftor.Methods: This was a nationwide observational cohort study (2018-2021) using data collected as part of the routine clinical surveillance programme (including MBW and monthly endo-laryngeal suction sampling for bacterial pathogens) in children born after implementation of newborn screening for CF (May 2016). Lumacaftor/ivacaftor commenced from age 2 years in children homozygous for F508del. Ventilation distribution efficiency (VDE), recently described to have advantages over lung clearance index (LCI), was reported as the primary MBW outcome after z-score calculations based on published reference data. Mixed effect linear regression models were the main statistical analyses performed in this study.Results: 59 children, aged 2-45 months, contributed with 211 MBW occasions (median (interquartile range (IQR)) 3 (2-5) MBW occasions per child) with a median (IQR) follow-up time of 10.8 (5.2-22.3) months. An overall mean annual deterioration rate of -0.50 (95% CI -0.78- -0.22) z-VDE was observed, starting from an estimated mean z-VDE of -1.68 (95% CI -2.15- -1.22) at age 0.0 years (intercept). *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* ""ever"" (n=14, MBWs 50) had a significantly worse z-VDE trajectory *versus P. aeruginosa* ""never"" (mean difference 0.53 (95% CI 0.16-0.89) per year; p=0.0047) and lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment (n=22, MBWs 46) significantly improved the trajectory of z-VDE (mean difference 1.72 (95% CI 0.79-2.66) per year; p=0.0004), leading to a stable mean z-VDE trajectory after start of treatment.Conclusions: Infants and toddlers with CF demonstrated progressive deterioration in z-VDE over the first years of life. *P. aeruginosa* isolation ""ever"" was associated with an accelerated deterioration in lung function, while lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy significantly improved and stabilised the trajectory.",37908398,PMC10613974,10.1183/23120541.00317-2023,,2023,"Sandvik RM, Schmidt MN, Voldby CM, Buchvald FF, Olesen HV, Olsen J, Kragh MV, Rubak SLM, Pressler T, Robinson PD, Gustafsson PM, Skov M, Nielsen KG.",Y,MED
Opportunistic Screening for Low Bone Mineral Density in Adults with Cystic Fibrosis Using Low-Dose Computed Tomography of the Chest with Artificial Intelligence.,"**Background:** Cystic fibrosis bone disease (CFBD) is a common comorbidity in adult people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), resulting in an increased risk of bone fractures. This study evaluated the capacity of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted low-dose chest CT (LDCT) opportunistic screening for detecting low bone mineral density (BMD) in adult pwCF. **Methods:** In this retrospective single-center study, 65 adult pwCF (mean age 30.1 ± 7.5 years) underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the lumbar vertebrae L1 to L4 to determine BMD and corresponding z-scores and completed LDCTs of the chest within three months as part of routine clinical care. A fully automated CT-based AI algorithm measured the attenuation values (Hounsfield units [HU]) of the thoracic vertebrae Th9-Th12 and first lumbar vertebra L1. The ability of the algorithm to diagnose CFBD was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. **Results:** HU values of Th9 to L1 and DXA-derived BMD and the corresponding z-scores of L1 to L4 showed a strong correlation (all *p* < 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) for diagnosing low BMD was highest for L1 (0.796; *p* = 0.001) and Th11 (0.835; *p* < 0.001), resulting in a specificity of 84.9% at a sensitivity level of 75%. The HU threshold values for distinguishing normal from low BMD were <197 (L1) and <212 (Th11), respectively. **Conclusions:** Routine LDCT of the chest with the fully automated AI-guided determination of thoracic and lumbar vertebral attenuation values is a valuable tool for predicting low BMD in adult pwCF, with the best results for Th11 and L1.

Impact of the expanded label for elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in people with cystic fibrosis with no F508del variant in the USA.,"Background: Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), which is approved for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) with a F508del variant, was further approved based on *in vitro* data in the USA for those carrying at least one of 177 rare *CFTR* (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) variants.Methods: PwCF, aged ≥6 years, carrying no F508del variant but with at least one of these 177 rare variants, were identified within the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) between 2020 and 2022. The evolution of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) percentage predicted and rates of pulmonary exacerbations were analysed over the first year following ETI initiation, using a linear regression with generalised estimating equations and a negative binomial model, respectively.Results: A total of 1791 individuals aged ≥6 years with rare *CFTR* variants were eligible for ETI, corresponding to 5.2% of CFFPR participants. 815 individuals (45.5%), of which 57.9% were already treated with another CFTR modulator, initiated ETI within the first 2 years following approval. Individuals with more severe respiratory disease were more likely to initiate ETI, whereas those previously treated with another CFTR modulator or those with no private insurance coverage had less ETI initiation. ETI initiation was associated with an increase in mean FEV1 % pred by +3.39 (95% CI 2.14-4.64) and a decrease in the rates of pulmonary exacerbations (adjusted rate ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.38-0.79).

The clinical impact of Lumacaftor-Ivacaftor on structural lung disease and lung function in children aged 6-11 with cystic fibrosis in a real-world setting.,"Background: Data from clinical trials of lumacaftor-ivacaftor (LUM-IVA) demonstrate improvements in lung clearance index (LCI) but not in FEV1 in children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) aged 6-11 years and homozygous for the Phe508del mutation. It is not known whether LUM/IVA use in children can impact the progression of structural lung disease. We sought to determine the real-world impact of LUM/IVA on lung structure and function in children aged 6-11 years.Methods: This real-world observational cohort study was conducted across four paediatric sites in Ireland over 24-months using spirometry-controlled CT scores and LCI as primary outcome measures. Children commencing LUM-/IVA as part of routine care were included. CT scans were manually scored with the PRAGMA CF scoring system and analysed using the automated bronchus-artery (BA) method. Secondary outcome measures included rate of change of ppFEV1, nutritional indices and exacerbations requiring hospitalisation.Results: Seventy-one participants were recruited to the study, 31 of whom had spirometry-controlled CT performed at baseline, and after one year and two years of LUM/IVA treatment. At two years there was a reduction from baseline in trapped air scores (0.13 to 0.07, p = 0.016), but an increase from baseline in the % bronchiectasis score (0.84 to 1.23, p = 0.007). There was no change in overall % disease score (2.78 to 2.25, p = 0.138). Airway lumen to pulmonary artery ratios (AlumenA ratio) were abnormal at baseline and worsened over the course of the study. In 28 participants, the mean annual change from baseline LCI2.5 (-0.055 (-0.61 to 0.50), p = 0.85) measurements over two years were not significant. Improvements from baseline in weight (0.10 (0.06 to 0.15, p < 0.0001), height (0.05 (0.02 to 0.09), p = 0.002) and BMI (0.09 (0.03 to 0.15) p = 0.005) z-scores were seen with LUM/IVA treatment. The mean annual change from baseline ppFEV1 (-2.45 (-4.44 to 2.54), p = 0.66) measurements over two years were not significant.Conclusion: In a real-world setting, the use of LUM/IVA over two years in children with CF aged 6-11 resulted in improvements in air trapping on CT but worsening in bronchiectasis scores. Our results suggest that LUM/IVA use in this age group improves air trapping but does not prevent progression of bronchiectasis over two years of treatment.",37568199,PMC10416528,10.1186/s12931-023-02497-0,,2023,"McNally P, Linnane B, Williamson M, Elnazir B, Short C, Saunders C, Kirwan L, David R, Kemner-Van de Corput MPC, Tiddens HAWM, Davies JC, Cox DW.",Y,MED
In utero and postnatal ivacaftor/lumacaftor therapy rescues multiorgan disease in CFTR-F508del ferrets.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, with F508del being the most prevalent mutation. The combination of CFTR modulators (potentiator and correctors) has provided benefit to CF patients carrying the F508del mutation; however, the safety and effectiveness of in utero combination modulator therapy remains unclear. We created a F508del ferret model to test whether ivacaftor/lumacaftor (VX-770/VX-809) therapy can rescue in utero and postnatal pathologies associated with CF. Using primary intestinal organoids and air-liquid interface cultures of airway epithelia, we demonstrate that the F508del mutation in ferret CFTR results in a severe folding and trafficking defect, which can be partially restored by treatment with CFTR modulators. In utero treatment of pregnant jills with ivacaftor/lumacaftor prevented meconium ileus at birth in F508del kits and sustained postnatal treatment of CF offspring improved survival and partially protected from pancreatic insufficiency. Withdrawal of ivacaftor/lumacaftor treatment from juvenile CF ferrets reestablished pancreatic and lung diseases, with altered pulmonary mechanics. These findings suggest that in utero intervention with a combination of CFTR modulators may provide therapeutic benefits to individuals with F508del. This CFTR-F508del ferret model may be useful for testing therapies using clinically translatable endpoints.",38646935,PMC11141870,10.1172/jci.insight.157229,,2024,"Evans IA, Sun X, Liang B, Vegter AR, Guo L, Lynch TJ, Zhang Y, Zhang Y, Yi Y, Yang Y, Feng Z, Park SY, Shonka A, McCumber H, Qi L, Wu P, Liu G, Lacina A, Wang K, Gibson-Corley KN, Meyerholz DK, Limoli DH, Rosen BH, Yan Z, Bartels DJ, Engelhardt JF.",Y,MED
Hypoglycaemia after Initiation of CFTR Modulator Therapy in a Cystic Fibrosis Patient without Diabetes.,"Introduction: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies improve respiratory function and glycaemic control in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The direct effect of CFTR modulator therapies on pancreatic function in patients without preexisting diabetes remains unclear. *Case Presentation*. An 18-year-old female with CF caused by F508del/F508del mutation, who had no diabetes, developed postprandial hypoglycaemias 6 months after initiation of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor combination therapy (ETI). Symptoms were persisted after brief discontinuation of ETI, but her symptoms and time-in-hypoglycaemia had improved remarkably by avoiding high glycaemic index-foods. *Discussion*. This case of hypoglycaemia associated with CFTR modulator therapy in a patient without preexisting diabetes suggests that CFTR modulator therapy has the potential to directly affect glucose homeostasis. There might be an improvement in insulin secretion as well as a reduction in systemic insulin resistance.Conclusion: Treatment of CF patients without diabetes with CFTR modulator therapies can cause recurrent hypoglycaemic episodes which resolve with dietary measures.",38161769,PMC10757659,10.1155/2023/9769119,,2023,"Yskout M, Vliebergh J, Bor H, Dupont L, Lorent N, Van Bleyenbergh P, Gillard P, Van der Schueren B, Mertens A, Mathieu C, Vangoitsenhoven R.",Y,MED

Clinical implications of innate immune exhaustion in cystic fibrosis.,"Objectives: Lung disease progression in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) varies from one individual to another. Different immunological characteristics have been suggested to explain this variation, and we hypothesised that lung capacity may be associated with the innate immune response in pwCF. In an exploratory study, we aimed to investigate potential links between the innate immune response and lung function in pwCF using the standardised immune function assay TruCulture.Methods: In a single-centre study with combined cross-sectional and longitudinal data before and after intravenous antibiotics, blood was sampled from *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*-infected pwCF. Whole blood was analysed by TruCulture to reveal the unstimulated and stimulated cytokine release. Tobit regressions and Spearman's correlations were used to estimate the associations between lung function and cytokine release.Results: We included 52 pwCF in the cross-sectional study and 24 in the longitudinal study. In the cross-sectional study, we found that compared to a healthy population, the release of toll-like receptor (TLR)3, TLR4- and TLR7/8-stimulated interferon-γ, and interleukin (IL)-12p40 was reduced. Although TLR3-stimulated IL-1β and IL-6 release increased with lung function, overall, cytokine release did not correlate well with lung function. In the longitudinal study, the cytokine release was modified by antibiotic treatment, but the cytokine release before antibiotic treatment did not associate with changes in lung function after treatment.Conclusion: The stimulated cytokine release could not predict lung function levels or changes in pwCF, but our data indicate that pwCF experience exhaustion in the innate immune response after years of chronic bacterial infection.",39193378,PMC11347999,10.1183/23120541.00256-2024,,2024,"Møller R, Uhre Nielsen B, Rossi E, Lausen M, Skov M, Pressler T, Ostrowski SR, Johansen HK.",Y,MED
Impact of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor therapy on lung clearance index and magnetic resonance imaging in children with cystic fibrosis and one or two *F508del* alleles.,"Background: We recently demonstrated that elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) improves the lung clearance index (LCI) and abnormalities in lung morphology detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in adolescent and adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, real-world data on the effect of ETI on these sensitive outcomes of lung structure and function in school-age children with CF have not been reported. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the effect of ETI on the LCI and the lung MRI score in children aged 6-11 years with CF and one or two *F508del* alleles.Methods: This prospective, observational, multicentre, post-approval study assessed the longitudinal LCI up to 12 months and the lung MRI score before and 3 months after initiation of ETI.Results: A total of 107 children with CF including 40 heterozygous for *F508del* and a minimal function mutation (F/MF) and 67 homozygous for *F508del* (F/F) were enrolled in this study. Treatment with ETI improved the median (interquartile range (IQR)) LCI in F/MF (-1.0 (-2.0- -0.1); p<0.01) and F/F children (-0.8 (-1.9- -0.2); p<0.001) from 3 months onwards. Further, ETI improved the median (IQR) MRI global score in F/MF (-4.0 (-9.0-0.0); p<0.01) and F/F children (-3.5 (-7.3- -0.8); p<0.001).Conclusions: ETI improves early abnormalities in lung ventilation and morphology in school-age children with CF and at least one *F508del* allele in a real-world setting. Our results support early initiation of ETI to reduce or even prevent lung disease progression in school-age children with CF.",38901883,PMC11375515,10.1183/13993003.00004-2024,,2024,"Stahl M, Dohna M, Graeber SY, Sommerburg O, Renz DM, Pallenberg ST, Voskrebenzev A, Schütz K, Hansen G, Doellinger F, Steinke E, Thee S, Röhmel J, Barth S, Rückes-Nilges C, Berges J, Hämmerling S, Wielpütz MO, Naehrlich L, Vogel-Claussen J, Tümmler B, Mall MA, Dittrich AM.",Y,MED
Effects of Lumacaftor-Ivacaftor on Airway Microbiota-Mycobiota and Inflammation in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis Appear To Be Linked to Pseudomonas aeruginosa Chronic Colonization.,"Lumacaftor-ivacaftor is a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator combination approved for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous for the F508del allele. This treatment showed significant clinical improvement; however, few studies have addressed the evolution of the airway microbiota-mycobiota and inflammation in patients receiving lumacaftor-ivacaftor treatment. Seventy-five patients with CF aged 12 years or older were enrolled at the initiation of lumacaftor-ivacaftor therapy. Among them, 41 had spontaneously produced sputa collected before and 6 months after treatment initiation. Airway microbiota and mycobiota analyses were performed via high-throughput sequencing. Airway inflammation was assessed by measuring the calprotectin levels in sputum; the microbial biomass was evaluated via quantitative PCR (qPCR). At baseline (*n* = 75), bacterial alpha-diversity was correlated with pulmonary function. After 6 months of lumacaftor-ivacaftor treatment, a significant improvement in the body mass index and a decreased number of intravenous antibiotic courses were noted. No significant changes in bacterial and fungal alpha- and beta-diversities, pathogen abundances, or calprotectin levels were observed. However, for patients not chronically colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa at treatment initiation, calprotectin levels were lower, and a significant increase in bacterial alpha-diversity was observed at 6 months. This study shows that the evolution of the airway microbiota-mycobiota in CF patients depends on the patient's characteristics at lumacaftor-ivacaftor treatment initiation, notably chronic colonization with P. aeruginosa. **IMPORTANCE** The management of cystic fibrosis has been transformed recently by the advent of CFTR modulators, including lumacaftor-ivacaftor. However, the effects of such therapies on the airway ecosystem, particularly on the microbiota-mycobiota and local inflammation, which are involved in the evolution of pulmonary damage, are unclear. This multicenter study of the evolution of the microbiota under protein therapy supports the notion that CFTR modulators should be started as soon as possible, ideally before the patient is chronically colonized with P. aeruginosa.

Oxidative Stress Biomarkers in Cystic Fibrosis and Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes in Children: A Literature Review.,"The most common inherited condition that results in death, particularly in those of Caucasian heritage, is cystic fibrosis (CF). Of all the young adults diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, 20% will develop hyperglycemia as a complication, later classified as a disease associated with cystic fibrosis. Impaired insulin secretion and glucose intolerance represent the primary mechanisms associated with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) and cystic fibrosis. Oxidative stress represents the imbalance between oxygen-reactive species and antioxidant defense mechanisms. This pathogenic mechanism is vital in triggering other chronic diseases, including cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. It is essential to understand oxidative stress and the significant impact it has on CFRD. This way, therapies can be individually adjusted and tailored to each patient's needs. This review aims to understand the connection between CFRD and oxidative stress. As a subsidiary element, we analyzed the effects of glycemic balance on complications and their evolution over time, providing insights into their potential benefits in mitigating oxidative stress-associated complications.",37893045,PMC10604378,10.3390/biomedicines11102671,,2023,"Pinzaru AD, Mihai CM, Chisnoiu T, Pantazi AC, Lupu VV, Kassim MAK, Lupu A, Grosan E, Al Jumaili AZN, Ion I, Stoleriu G, Ion I.",Y,MED
Effects of CFTR modulators on serum biomarkers of liver fibrosis in children with cystic fibrosis.,"The cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator corrector/potentiator combinations lumacaftor/ivacaftor and elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor improve sweat chloride, pulmonary function, and nutrition. Yet it is unclear whether they may also impact the progression of liver fibrosis, which is a substantial source of morbidity and mortality for patients with CF. We conducted a retrospective, single-center analysis of children and adolescents with CF treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and/or elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor therapy, focusing on alterations in liver function tests and fibrosis indices using previously-established thresholds that corresponded with increased liver elastography. In pairwise comparisons of before and during treatment timepoints, we found that those with CF-associated liver involvement experienced significant decreases in gamma-glutamyl transferase, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet index, and gamma-glutamyl transferase-to-platelet ratio while on lumacaftor/ivacaftor. These differences were not observed in patients treated with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor, nor were they observed in patients without underlying CF-associated liver disease. These results provide the first evidence that lumacaftor/ivacaftor may improve liver fibrosis in children and adolescents with CF and suggest it may be beneficial in the treatment of CF-associated liver disease.",36662672,PMC10019140,10.1097/hc9.0000000000000010,,2023,"Levitte S, Fuchs Y, Wise R, Sellers ZM.",Y,MED
The ageing of people living with cystic fibrosis: what to expect now?,"The prognosis of people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) has improved dramatically with the introduction of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators (CFTRm). The ageing of the cystic fibrosis (CF) population is changing the disease landscape with the emergence of different needs and increasing comorbidities related to both age and long-term exposure to multiple treatments including CFTRm. Although the number of pwCF eligible for this treatment is expected to increase, major disparities in care and outcomes still exist in this population. Moreover, the long-term impact of the use of CFTRm is still partly unknown due to the current short follow-up and experience with their use, thus generating some uncertainties. The future spread and initiation of these drugs at an earlier stage of the disease is expected to reduce the systemic burden of systemic inflammation and its consequences on health. However, the prolonged life expectancy is accompanied by an increasing burden of age-related comorbidities, especially in the context of chronic disease. The clinical manifestations of the comorbidities directly or indirectly associated with CFTR dysfunction are changing, along with the disease dynamics and outcomes. Current protocols used to monitor slow disease progression will need continuous updates, including the composition of the multidisciplinary team for CF care, with a greater focus on the needs of the adult population.",39477350,PMC11522972,10.1183/16000617.0071-2024,,2024,"Felipe Montiel A, Fernández AÁ, Amigo MC, Traversi L, Clofent Alarcón D, Reyes KL, Polverino E.",Y,MED
Effects of lumacaftor-ivacaftor therapy on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator function in F508del homozygous patients with cystic fibrosis aged 2-11 years.,"**Rationale:** Lumacaftor/ivacaftor was approved for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for F508del aged 2 years and older following positive results from phase three trials. However, the improvement in CFTR function associated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor has only been studied in patients over 12 years of age, while the rescue potential in younger children is unknown. **Methods:** In a prospective study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of lumacaftor/ivacaftor on the CFTR biomarkers sweat chloride concentration and intestinal current measurement as well as clinical outcome parameters in F508del homozygous CF patients 2-11 years before and 8-16 weeks after treatment initiation. **Results:** A total of 13 children with CF homozygous for F508del aged 2-11 years were enrolled and 12 patients were analyzed. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment reduced sweat chloride concentration by 26.8 mmol/L (*p* = 0.0006) and showed a mean improvement in CFTR activity, as assessed by intestinal current measurement in the rectal epithelium, of 30.5% compared to normal (*p* = 0.0015), exceeding previous findings of 17.7% of normal in CF patients homozygous for F508del aged 12 years and older. **Conclusion:** Lumacaftor/ivacaftor partially restores F508del CFTR function in children with CF who are homozygous for F508del, aged 2-11 years, to a level of CFTR activity seen in patients with CFTR variants with residual function. These results are consistent with the partial short-term improvement in clinical parameters.",37324488,PMC10266342,10.3389/fphar.2023.1188051,,2023,"Berges J, Graeber SY, Hämmerling S, Yu Y, Krümpelmann A, Stahl M, Hirtz S, Scheuermann H, Mall MA, Sommerburg O.",Y,MED

Clinical significance of BPI-ANCA in patients with cystic fibrosis: a single center prospective study.,"Recurrent pulmonary exacerbation due to infection and inflammation remain the major cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Increased levels of BPI-ANCA have been linked to Pseudomonas colonization and pulmonary exacerbations in patients with CF. The majority of these studies were done in Europe, and it is unclear whether similar findings are true in CF patients who lives in United States. In our single center study of 47 patients with CF, the prevalence of BPI-ANCA was 19% at baseline and 15% at annual follow-up visit. Overall, there were no statistical differences noted in FEV1 and frequency of pulmonary exacerbations in CF patients who were positive for BPI-ANCA compared to those who were negative for BPI-ANCA.

Evaluating precision medicine tools in cystic fibrosis for racial and ethnic fairness.,"Introduction: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience frequent episodes of acute decline in lung function called pulmonary exacerbations (PEx). An existing clinical and place-based precision medicine algorithm that accurately predicts PEx could include racial and ethnic biases in clinical and geospatial training data, leading to unintentional exacerbation of health inequities.Methods: We estimated receiver operating characteristic curves based on predictions from a nonstationary Gaussian stochastic process model for PEx within 3, 6, and 12 months among 26,392 individuals aged 6 years and above (2003-2017) from the US CF Foundation Patient Registry. We screened predictors to identify reasons for discriminatory model performance.Results: The precision medicine algorithm performed worse predicting a PEx among Black patients when compared with White patients or to patients of another race for all three prediction horizons. There was little to no difference in prediction accuracies among Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients for the same prediction horizons. Differences in F508del, smoking households, secondhand smoke exposure, primary and secondary road densities, distance and drive time to the CF center, and average number of clinical evaluations were key factors associated with race.Conclusions: Racial differences in prediction accuracies from our PEx precision medicine algorithm exist. Misclassification of future PEx was attributable to several underlying factors that correspond to race: CF mutation, location where the patient lives, and clinical awareness. Associations of our proxies with race for CF-related health outcomes can lead to systemic racism in data collection and in prediction accuracies from precision medicine algorithms constructed from it.",39220818,PMC11362628,10.1017/cts.2024.532,,2024,"Colegate SP, Palipana A, Gecili E, Szczesniak RD, Brokamp C.",Y,MED
Therapeutic Interventions for *Pseudomonas* Infections in Cystic Fibrosis Patients: A Review of Phase IV Trials.,"*Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (*Pa*) poses a significant threat to individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), as this bacterium is highly adaptable and resistant to antibiotics. While early-stage *Pa* infections can often be eradicated with aggressive antibiotic therapy, chronic infections are nearly impossible to eliminate and require treatments that focus on long-term bacterial suppression. Without such suppression, these persistent infections can severely damage the lungs, leading to serious complications and a reduced life expectancy for CF patients. Evidence for a specific treatment regimen for managing Pa infections in CF patients remains limited. This narrative review provides a detailed analysis of antimicrobial therapies assessed in completed phase IV trials, focusing on their safety and efficacy, especially with prolonged use. Key antibiotics, including tobramycin, colistin, meropenem, aztreonam, ceftolozane/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, and azithromycin, are discussed, emphasizing their use, side effects, and delivery methods. Inhaled antibiotics are preferred for their targeted action and minimal side effects, while systemic antibiotics offer potency but carry risks like nephrotoxicity. The review also explores emerging treatments, such as phage therapy and antibiofilm agents, which show promise in managing chronic infections. Nonetheless, further research is necessary to enhance the safety and effectiveness of existing therapies while investigating new approaches for better long-term outcomes.",39518670,PMC11547045,10.3390/jcm13216530,,2024,Alqasmi M.,Y,MED
Attitudes toward and preparedness for lung transplantation among individuals with cystic fibrosis in the era of highly effective modulators.,"Background: Outcomes for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) have improved due to highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT). However, lung transplant (LTx) remains an important treatment for people with advanced lung disease. This study assessed attitudes and knowledge about LTx in the HEMT era.Methods: All patients from the University of Washington CF clinic were surveyed March 25-May 30, 2020. Questions addressed self-rated LTx preparedness and knowledge, as well as barriers and facilitators to discussing LTx. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from the electronic health record.Results: There were 159/224 (71%) responses. Respondents had a median forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 70%, and 142 (89%) were on modulatory therapy. One hundred thirteen (71%) respondents felt that it was moderately or very important to be prepared to make decisions about LTx, though only 56 (35%) felt moderately or very prepared. Only 83 (30%) and 47 (52%) participants correctly answered questions about life expectancy and improved quality of life after LTx, respectively. Respondents with Medicaid insurance less frequently answered questions correctly. The most common barriers to discussing LTx were fear of being a burden on loved ones for 58 respondents (36%) and cost of LTx for 46 (29%). Most participants (94%) trusted their CF doctor, and 75% of participants selected trust as a facilitator for LTx discussions.Conclusions: Many individuals with CF, especially those with lower socioeconomic status, lacked knowledge and did not feel very prepared for decisions about LTx.

One year of treatment with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation causes a significant increase in liver biochemical indexes.,"**Introduction:** Modulators of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutated protein significantly improved the outcome of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We describe 63 patients who were independently followed up in two CF regional centers (i.e., Campania and Tuscany regions). **Methods:** All patients were homozygous for the F508del mutation and were treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LI) for 3 years, followed by 1 year of treatment with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). We studied the biochemical parameters of liver damage and cholesterol metabolism. **Results:** Beyond the improvement of BMI and lung function with LI treatment and even more with ETI, we found that the 3 years of LI treatment significantly improved liver function parameters (total and conjugated bilirubin, ALT, AP, and GGT), while the subsequent ETI treatment caused a significant increase of such parameters. **Discussion:** We confirm that treatment with LI does not correct hypocholesterolemia, whereas treatment with ETI significantly increases serum cholesterol. Such an increase is likely due to enhanced *de novo* biosynthesis, as indicated by the significant increase in serum lathosterol, and it is likely that the subsequent liver cholesterol accumulation may contribute to triggering inflammation and worsening liver biochemical indexes. The increase in serum bilirubin and ALT that we observed in approximately 94% and 84% of patients treated with ETI, respectively, suggests further investigation of the impact of ETI therapy on liver function indexes.",38259684,PMC10800484,10.3389/fmolb.2023.1327958,,2023,"Castaldo A, Gelzo M, Iacotucci P, Longobardi A, Taccetti G, Terlizzi V, Carnovale V.",Y,MED
Lentiviral Gene Therapy for Cystic Fibrosis: A Promising Approach and First-in-Human Trial.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the *CFTR* (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene. Although CF is a multiorgan disease, the leading causes of morbidity and mortality are related to progressive lung disease. Current understanding of the effects of the broad spectrum of *CFTR* mutations on CFTR function has allowed for the development of CFTR modulator therapies. Despite the remarkable impact that these therapies have had, there remains a significant proportion of people with CF (estimated at 10-15% of the global CF population) who are genetically ineligible for, or intolerant of, current CFTR-targeting therapies and whose therapeutic needs remain unmet. Inhaled genetic therapies offer the prospect of addressing the unmet pulmonary treatment need in people with CF, with several approaches, including gene addition therapy (the focus of this review), RNA-based therapies, antisense oligonucleotides, and gene editing, being explored. Various nonviral and viral vectors have been investigated for CF gene addition therapy for mutation-agnostic restoration of CFTR function in the lungs. Lentiviral vectors offer the prospect of highly efficient and long-lasting gene expression, and the potential to be safely and, in contrast to other commonly used viral vectors, effectively redosed. A third-generation lentiviral vector pseudotyped with Sendai virus F and HN envelope proteins (rSIV.F/HN) has been developed for the treatment of CF. Promising preclinical results support the progression of this vector carrying a full-length *CFTR* transgene (BI 3720931) into a first-in-human clinical trial expected to begin in 2024.",39236265,PMC11716034,10.1164/rccm.202402-0389ci,,2024,"Davies JC, Polineni D, Boyd AC, Donaldson S, Gill DR, Griesenbach U, Hyde SC, Jain R, McLachlan G, Mall MA, Alton EWFW.",Y,MED
Chronic *Escherichia coli* ST648 Infections in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis: The In Vitro Effects of an Antivirulence Agent.,"Extraintestinal pathogenic *Escherichia coli* causes community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia and poses a risk of infection, especially for patients with impaired lung function, such individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). When chronic infection develops, eradication of the pathogen is difficult even with aggressive antibacterial therapy and targeted CF treatment. A new agent, Fluorthiazinone (CL-55), an inhibitor of bacterial virulence, was registered in Russia in 2024. The aim of our study was to characterize the genomes of *E. coli* ST648 isolated from long-term-infected CF patients, describe virulence factors, and investigate the effect of CL-55 on two CF isolates in vitro. Comparison of the genomes of hypermucoviscous isolates showed that, in the presence of a large number of core genes, the isolates have adaptive differences both in their chromosomes and the composition and genes of their plasmidomes.

Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in patients with cystic fibrosis ineligible for clinical trials: a 24-week observational study.,"**Introduction:** Seminal clinical trials with the triple combination of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) demonstrated clinical efficacy in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) who carry at least one F508del mutation. However, due to exclusion criteria of these clinical trials, the effect of ETI was not studied in a substantial number of pwCF. Thus, we ran a single center trial to evaluate a clinical efficacy of ETI treatment in adult pwCF who were ineligible for enrollment in registration studies. **Methods:** PwCF on ETI with prior lumacaftor-ivacaftor therapy, severe airway obstruction, well-preserved lung function, or with airway infection with pathogens at risk of more rapid decline in lung function formed the study group, while all the others on ETI formed the control group. Lung function, nutritional status and sweat chloride concentration were assessed before and after initialization of ETI therapy over a 6-month period. **Results:** Approximately a half of the ETI-treated pwCF at the adult Prague CF center (49 of 96) were assigned to the study group. Their mean changes in body mass index ( + 1.04 kg/m2) and in sweat chloride concentration (-48.4 mmol/L) were similar to the control group ( + 1.02 kg/m2; -49.7 mmol/L), while the mean change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV1; + 10.3 points) was significantly lower than in the control group ( + 15.8 points) (*p* = 0.0015). In the subgroup analysis, pwCF with severe airway obstruction (ppFEV1 <40) and pwCF with well-preserved lung function (ppFEV1 >90) showed a less potential for improvement in lung function during the ETI treatment than controls (median change in ppFEV1 + 4.9 points and + 9.5 points, respectively). **Conclusion:** PwCF not eligible for inclusion in clinical trials demonstrated improvement in lung function and nutritional status following the initiation of treatment with the ETI combination. Moderate increase in ppFEV1 was observed in those with severe airway obstruction or well-preserved lung function.",37332357,PMC10275572,10.3389/fphar.2023.1178009,,2023,"Fila L, Grandcourtova A, Bilkova A, Drevinek P.",Y,MED
"Baseline-dependent improvement in CF studies, plausibility of bias.","Background: It has been commonly reported that therapeutic treatments in cystic fibrosis (CF) have ceiling effects, such that their efficacy is diminished for persons with high pre-treatment health (Montgomery et al., 2012 and Newsome et al., 2019). Floor effects have also been reported where decline is of lower magnitude in those with below-average pre-treatment health (Harun et al., 2016; Konstan et al., 2012 and Szczesniak et al., 2017). When measurement error is present, the statistical literature has warned of exaggerated or spurious associations between pre-treatment measures and subsequent change (Chambless and Davis, 2003 and Yanez et al., 1998). Measurement error, equivalently described as day-to-day variation, has been described to occur in CF outcome measurements such as forced expiratory volume in 1 s taken by spirometry (FEV 1 pp) (Magaret et al., 2024; Stanojevic et al., 2020 and Thornton et al., 2023).Methods: We conducted a simulation study to assess the potential for spurious floor or ceiling effects in studies of CF therapeutics. We considered uncontrolled or single-arm studies, and evaluated estimated association between pre-treatment FEV 1 pp and treatment-induced change: post-versus pre-treatment.Results: When day-to-day variation was present in FEV 1 pp, at levels equivalent to those reported in large studies measuring spirometry both at home and in clinic, naive analytic approaches found spurious associations of change with baseline (Paynter et al., 2022 and Saiman et al., 2003). Type I error ranged from 31.9% to 98.3% for day-to-day variation as high as 3% to 15% relative to biological variation. Incorporating known day-to-day variation, the regression calibration approach corrected bias and controlled type I error (Chambless and Davis, 2003).Conclusion: Exaggerated ceiling effects are possible. Further studies could provide meaningful confirmation of ceiling effects in CF, perhaps reducing day-to-day variation by incorporating multiple pre- and post-treatment measurements.",39678155,PMC11639362,10.1016/j.conctc.2024.101378,,2024,"Graham E, Heltshe SL, Magaret AS.",Y,MED
Hope in Every Breath: Navigating the Therapeutic Landscape of Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) has long posed a complex challenge to medical science. Still, the tides are turning with remarkable progress in prognosis and demographics, thanks to cutting-edge medical management and treatment breakthroughs. It affects multiple systems, necessitating a comprehensive approach to its management. This article thoroughly reviews the latest advancements in CF treatment across three key areas: respiratory care, infection prevention, and pharmacological management. In respiratory care, emphasis is placed on airway clearance therapies and nebulized saline, while infection prevention strategies encompass hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, and environmental cleaning and disinfection. Pharmacological management explores pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), antimicrobial treatments, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) modulators, and promising gene therapies. Patient education and support are highlighted as crucial components of effective CF management, while mental health assessments are emphasized due to CF patients' susceptibility to anxiety and depression. This review highlights the tremendous progress made in the management of CF. Integrating early detection, infection prevention, pharmacological interventions, gene therapy, and patient support is revolutionizing the care and quality of life for individuals with CF.",37719614,PMC10504422,10.7759/cureus.43603,,2023,"Sreenivasulu H, Muppalla SK, Vuppalapati S, Shokrolahi M, Reddy Pulliahgaru A.",Y,MED
Real-world effectiveness of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor on the burden of illness in adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) has been shown to be safe and efficacious in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged ≥2 years. Here, we describe results from an observational study assessing change in burden of illness following initiating ELX/TEZ/IVA in real-world settings.Methods: This US-based, multicenter, observational study used data from electronic medical records to evaluate real-world burden of illness before and after ELX/TEZ/IVA initiation in people with CF aged ≥12 years heterozygous for *F508del* and a minimal function mutation (*F*/MF) or an uncharacterized *CFTR* mutation. Endpoints included absolute change from baseline in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV1), body mass index (BMI) and BMI-for-age z-score, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and numbers of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx).Results: Overall, 206 people with CF were enrolled (mean [SD] age 22.5 [11.1] years; 192 [93.2%] with *F*/MF genotype). Mean follow-up was 15.6 (SD, 1.6) months. Improvements in ppFEV1 (7.3 [95% CI: 5.7, 8.8] percentage points) were observed from baseline through follow-up. Increases in BMI (1.40 [95% CI: 1.07, 1.77] kg/m2) and BMI-for-age z-score (0.14 [95% CI: 0.00, 0.28]) were also observed from baseline at 12 months. The estimated annualized rate of any PEx was 1.31 at baseline and 0.61 over follow-up (rate ratio 0.47 [95% CI: 0.39, 0.55]), with annualized rates of PEx requiring antibiotics and hospitalizations of 0.55 and 0.88 in the baseline period and 0.12 and 0.36 over follow-up (rate ratios 0.22 [95% CI: 0.15, 0.31] and 0.41 [95% CI: 0.32, 0.51]), respectively. Absolute change in HbA1c was -0.22 (95% CI: -0.38, -0.06) from baseline through follow-up.Conclusions: ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment was associated with improved lung function, increased BMI, reduced frequency of PEx, and improved (i.e., reduced) HbA1c. These results confirm the broad clinical benefits of ELX/TEZ/IVA seen in clinical trials and show the potential for ELX/TEZ/IVA to improve markers of glucose metabolism.",38586424,PMC10998118,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e28508,,2024,"Keens T, Hoffman V, Topuria I, Elder K, Cerf S, Mulder K, Roberts J, Lysinger J, Del Carmen Reyes M, Berdella M, Cairns AM, Jain M, Ganapathy V, Lou Y, Morcos B, Wu C, Sass L, VX19-CFD-003 Study Group.",Y,MED
Use of elexacaftor+tezacaftor+ivacaftor in individuals with cystic fibrosis and at least one F508del allele: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Objective: To evaluate the effect of treatment with the combination of three cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators-elexacaftor+tezacaftor+ivacaftor (ETI)-on important clinical endpoints in individuals with cystic fibrosis.Methods: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials that compared the use of ETI in individuals with CF and at least one F508del allele with that of placebo or with an active comparator such as other combinations of CFTR modulators, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations and the Patients of interest, Intervention to be studied, Comparison of interventions, and Outcome of interest (PICO) methodology. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov from their inception to December 26th, 2022. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, and the quality of evidence was based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).Results: We retrieved 54 studies in the primary search. Of these, 6 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed (1,127 patients; 577 and 550 in the intervention and control groups, respectively). The meta-analysis revealed that the use of ETI increased FEV1% [risk difference (RD), +10.47%; 95% CI, 6.88-14.06], reduced the number of acute pulmonary exacerbations (RD, -0.16; 95% CI, -0.28 to -0.04), and improved quality of life (RD, +14.93; 95% CI, 9.98-19.89) and BMI (RD, +1.07 kg/m2; 95% CI, 0.90-1.25). Adverse events did not differ between groups (RD, -0.03; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.01), and none of the studies reported deaths.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that ETI treatment substantially improves clinically significant, patient-centered outcomes.",38198345,PMC10760416,10.36416/1806-3756/e20230187,,2024,"Silva Filho LVRFD, Athanazio RA, Tonon CR, Ferreira JC, Tanni SE.",Y,MED
Lentiviral vector gene therapy and CFTR modulators show comparable effectiveness in cystic fibrosis rat airway models.,"Mutation-agnostic treatments such as airway gene therapy have the potential to treat any individual with cystic fibrosis (CF), irrespective of their CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene variants. The aim of this study was to employ two CF rat models, Phe508del and CFTR knockout (KO), to assess the comparative effectiveness of CFTR modulators and lentiviral (LV) vector-mediated gene therapy. Cells were isolated from the tracheas of rats and used to establish air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures. Phe508del rat ALIs were treated with the modulator combination, elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI), and separate groups of Phe508del and KO tracheal epithelial cells were treated with LV-CFTR followed by differentiation at ALI. Ussing chamber measurements were performed to assess CFTR function. ETI-treated Phe508del ALI cultures demonstrated CFTR function that was 59% of wild-type level, while gene-addition therapy restored Phe508del to 68% and KO to 47% of wild-type level, respectively. Our findings show that rat Phe508del-CFTR protein can be successfully rescued with ETI treatment, and that CFTR gene-addition therapy provides significant CFTR correction in Phe508del and KO ALI cultures to levels that were comparable to ETI. These findings highlight the potential of an LV vector-based gene therapy for the treatment of CF lung disease.",39183346,PMC11576507,10.1038/s41434-024-00480-y,,2024,"McCarron A, Ling KM, Montgomery ST, Martinovich KM, Cmielewski P, Rout-Pitt N, Kicic A, Parsons D, Donnelley M.",Y,MED
Dysregulation of the Arachidonic Acid Pathway in Cystic Fibrosis: Implications for Chronic Inflammation and Disease Progression.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal genetic disease among Caucasian people, with over 2000 mutations in the CFTR gene. Although highly effective modulators have been developed to rescue the mutant CFTR protein, unresolved inflammation and persistent infections still threaten the lives of patients. While the central role of arachidonic acid (AA) and its metabolites in the inflammatory response is widely recognized, less is known about their impact on immunomodulation and metabolic implications in CF. To this end, here we provided a comprehensive analysis of the AA metabolism in CF. In this context, CFTR dysfunction appeared to complexly disrupt normal lipid processing, worsening the chronic airway inflammation, and compromising the immune responses to bacterial infections. As such, potential strategies targeting AA and its inflammatory mediators are being investigated as a promising approach to balance the inflammatory response while mitigating disease progression. Thus, a deeper understanding of the AA pathway dysfunction in CF may open innovative avenues for designing more effective therapeutic interventions.",39338347,PMC11434829,10.3390/ph17091185,,2024,"D'Orazio S, Mattoscio D.",Y,MED
Multiple-breath washout to detect lung disease in patients with inborn errors of immunity.,"Background: Pulmonary manifestations are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI). New and more sensitive diagnostic methods can potentially lead to earlier recognition and treatment of IEI lung disease and improve outcome. The aim of this study was to compare multiple-breath washout (MBW) and spirometry in patients with IEI and cystic fibrosis (CF) as well as healthy controls (HC) and to evaluate the sensitivity of lung clearance index (LCI) to assess lung disease in IEI.Methods: IEI patients (n=114) were recruited from our paediatric and adult immunodeficiency outpatient clinics and compared to age-matched CF patients (n=114) and HC (n=114). MBW measurements and spirometry were performed in the study participants, and MBW testing was repeated after 63-707 days in IEI patients (n=70).Results: The LCI was significantly higher in IEI patients than in HC (*p*<0.001) and significantly lower than in CF patients (p<0.001). The forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) z-score was significantly lower in IEI patients than in HC (p<0.01) and significantly higher than in CF patients (p<0.01). LCI and FEV1 z-score correlated moderately negatively in the total cohort, the IEI group and the CF group. Nineteen (20.7%) of 92 IEI patients and 35 (33.3%) of 105 CF patients had an elevated LCI but a normal FEV1 z-score. After a median of 364 days, the median LCI of 70 IEI patients increased significantly by 0.2.Conclusion: MBW is useful to detect lung disease in IEI and is more sensitive than spirometry.",38469376,PMC10926008,10.1183/23120541.01019-2023,,2024,"Busack LM, Thee S, Liu Y, Allomba C, Ziegahn N, Tosolini A, Pioch CO, Schnorr AN, Fuhlrott BR, Staudacher O, Völler M, Steinke E, Hanitsch LG, Röhmel J, Wahn V, Krüger R, Mall MA, von Bernuth H, Stahl M.",Y,MED
Cystic Fibrosis: A Journey through Time and Hope.,"Just over thirty years is the span of a generation. It is also the time that has passed since the discovery of the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis. Today, it is safe to say that this discovery has revolutionized our understanding, research perspectives, and management of this disease, which was, thirty years ago, a pediatric condition with a grim prognosis. The aim of this review is to present the advances that science and medicine have brought to our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and its management, which in many ways, epitomizes modern molecular genetic research. Since the discovery of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene in 1989, modeling the CFTR protein, deciphering its function as an ion channel, and identifying its molecular partners have led to numerous therapeutic advances. The most significant advancement in this field has been the discovery of protein modulators that can target its membrane localization and chloride channel activity. However, further progress is needed to ensure that all patients can benefit from a therapy tailored to their mutations, with the primary challenge being the development of treatments for mutations leading to a complete absence of the protein. The present review delves into the history of the multifaceted world of CF, covering main historical facts, current landscape, clinical management, emerging therapies, patient perspectives, and the importance of ongoing research, bridging science and medicine in the fight against the disease.",39273547,PMC11394767,10.3390/ijms25179599,,2024,"Trouvé P, Saint Pierre A, Férec C.",Y,MED
Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor Improves Sinonasal Outcomes in Young Children With Cystic Fibrosis.,"Background: Severe chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a near universal manifestation of cystic fibrosis. Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) is an oral, small molecule, highly effective Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) corrector-potentiator drug. In people with cystic fibrosis age > 12 years, ETI improves sinonasal symptoms, endoscopy findings, polyp size, and radiologic findings. This study evaluates changes in CRS in children ages 6-12 years newly started on ETI.Methods: This was a prospective, three center, pre-post study of 11 children age 6-11 years newly started on ETI. Study endpoints included the SN-5 sinonasal health survey, Sniffin' Kids olfaction test, a sinus computerized tomography (CT) scan, and nasal endoscopy with mucus sampling for full-length 16S rRNA sequencing microbiome analysis. Study visits were conducted before ETI and at a median of 9 months after treatment initiation.Results: ETI lead to improvement in symptoms, endoscopy scores and radiologic findings of CRS. Olfaction was below normal at baseline and did not improve. The sinonasal microbiome was dominated by typically commensal organisms before and after treatment for most participants. Additionally, Staphylococcus aureus was found in five participants at baseline and six participants on treatment.Conclusions: ETI improves sinonasal symptoms and endoscopy findings in children 6-11 years of age. Olfaction did not improve with ETI treatment in this age group, suggesting that olfactory dysfunction associated with CF is established early in life.

Advances in the Study of Common and Rare *CFTR* Complex Alleles Using Intestinal Organoids.,"Complex alleles (CAs) arise when two or more nucleotide variants are present on a single allele. CAs of the *CFTR* gene complicate the cystic fibrosis diagnosis process, classification of pathogenic variants, and determination of the clinical picture of the disease and increase the need for additional studies to determine their pathogenicity and modulatory effect in response to targeted therapy. For several different populations around the world, characteristic CAs of the *CFTR* gene have been discovered, although in general the prevalence and pathogenicity of CAs have not been sufficiently studied. This review presents examples of using intestinal organoid models for assessments of the two most common and two rare *CFTR* CAs in individuals with cystic fibrosis in Russia.",38392563,PMC10890655,10.3390/jpm14020129,,2024,"Krasnova M, Efremova A, Mokrousova D, Bukharova T, Kashirskaya N, Kutsev S, Kondratyeva E, Goldshtein D.",Y,MED
Response to Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor in people with cystic fibrosis with the N1303K mutation: Case report and review of the literature.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Thousands of CFTR mutations have been identified, but only a fraction are known to cause CF, with the most common being the prototypical class II CFTR mutation F508del. Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor (ETI) is a CFTR modulator that significantly increases ppFEV1 and reduces exacerbation frequencies. It is indicated for people with CF (pwCF) 2 years or older with at least one copy of F508del or one copy of the other 177 CFTR mutations that are responsive to ETI based on clinical or *in vitro* data. N1303K is the second most common class II mutation in the U.S. but is not yet FDA-approved for CFTR modulator therapy. However, N1303K is very similar to the F508del mutation and reveals variable *in vitro* responses to ETI. Theratyping provides an opportunity to consider ETI therapy for pwCF with mutations currently not approved by the FDA. We describe the case of an adult CF patient with W1282X and N1303K CFTR mutations and advanced CF lung disease (ACFLD) and declining lung function in which ETI was started after theratyping of nasal cells showed a meaningful response to ETI (current enhanced to over 10% of WT CFTR). The patient experienced clinical improvement with a 5% improvement in ppFEV1 and 10% increase in weight. However, there was no change in sweat chloride and the increase in ppFEV1 was less than what has been described for ACFLD patients with more typical ETI-amenable mutations. However, the response was in line with a few other cases described in the literature. This suggests a partial functional CFTR rescue like first-generation modulators for F508del. Thus, pwCF with N1303K CFTR variant could be considered for ETI eligibility.",38463894,PMC10920363,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e26955,,2024,"Tupayachi Ortiz MG, Baumlin N, Yoshida M, Salathe M.",Y,MED
Social-environmental phenotypes of rapid cystic fibrosis lung disease progression in adolescents and young adults living in the United States.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease but is greatly impacted by non-genetic (social/environmental and stochastic) influences. Some people with CF experience rapid decline, a precipitous drop in lung function relative to patient- and/or center-level norms. Those who experience rapid decline in early adulthood, compared to adolescence, typically exhibit less severe clinical disease but greater loss of lung function. The extent to which timing and degree of rapid decline are informed by social and environmental determinants of health (geomarkers) is unknown.Methods: A longitudinal cohort study was performed (24,228 patients, aged 6-21 years) using the U.S. CF Foundation Patient Registry. Geomarkers at the ZIP Code Tabulation Area level measured air pollution/respiratory hazards, greenspace, crime, and socioeconomic deprivation. A composite score quantifying social-environmental adversity was created and used in covariate-adjusted functional principal component analysis, which was applied to cluster longitudinal lung function trajectories.Results: Social-environmental phenotyping yielded three primary phenotypes that corresponded to early, middle, and late timing of peak decline in lung function over age. Geographic differences were related to distinct cultural and socioeconomic regions. Extent of peak decline, estimated as forced expiratory volume in 1 s of % predicted/year, ranged from 2.8 to 4.1 % predicted/year depending on social-environmental adversity. Middle decliners with increased social-environmental adversity experienced rapid decline 14.2 months earlier than their counterparts with lower social-environmental adversity, while timing was similar within other phenotypes. Early and middle decliners experienced mortality peaks during early adolescence and adulthood, respectively.Conclusion: While early decliners had the most severe CF lung disease, middle and late decliners lost more lung function. Higher social-environmental adversity associated with increased risk of rapid decline and mortality during young adulthood among middle decliners. This sub-phenotype may benefit from enhanced lung-function monitoring and personalized secondary environmental health interventions to mitigate chemical and non-chemical stressors.",38094913,PMC10718514,10.1016/j.envadv.2023.100449,,2023,"Palipana AK, Vancil A, Gecili E, Rasnick E, Ehrlich D, Pestian T, Andrinopoulou ER, Afonso PM, Keogh RH, Ni Y, Dexheimer JW, Clancy JP, Ryan P, Brokamp C, Szczesniak RD.",Y,MED

Modulator-refractory cystic fibrosis: Defining the scope and challenges of an emerging at-risk population.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) causes life-shortening respiratory and systemic disease due to dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. Highly effective modulator therapies (HEMT) improve the lives of many people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) by correcting the structure and function of the defective CFTR channel at the molecular level. Despite these advancements, a subset of patients-termed modulator-refractory CF-continues to experience two or more pulmonary exacerbations per year requiring hospitalization or intravenous antibiotics, regardless of other modulator benefits. This underrecognized group represents an emerging challenge within the CF community. We discuss the benefits and limitations of current CFTR modulator therapies and the urgent need to investigate this emerging at-risk population. While HEMT improves lung function, decreases exacerbations, reduces the need for lung transplantation, and lowers mortality, increasing evidence shows that not all patients benefit equally. At the University of Virginia, nearly 6% of adults with CF exhibit the modulator-refractory phenotype. The driving factors of modulator-refractory CF are likely multifactorial, including genetic variations, variable immune responses, preexisting bronchiectasis, microbiological colonization, preexisting comorbid conditions, and environmental and socioeconomic factors. This perspective review recognizes and defines modulator-refractory CF as a distinct emerging clinical phenotype in the post-modulator era. Understanding this phenotype is crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality, and for improving the quality of life for PwCF. Raising awareness of modulator-refractory CF will help the community address this population and perform further research to identify causes. The emergence of modulator-refractory CF highlights a significant gap in our current treatment landscape and provides an opportunity to develop innovative therapeutic strategies that may benefit the entire CF community, ensuring that no person with CF is left behind.",39543951,PMC11565698,10.1177/17534666241297877,,2024,"Somerville L, Borish L, Noth I, Albon D.",Y,MED
Treatable traits and challenges in the clinical management of non-tuberculous mycobacteria lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis.,"Introduction: Over the last ten years an increasing prevalence and incidence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) has been reported among patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) Viviani (J Cyst Fibros, 15(5):619-623, 2016). NTM pulmonary disease has been associated with negative clinical outcomes and often requires pharmacological treatment. Although specific guidelines help clinicians in the process of diagnosis and clinical management, the focus on the multidimensional assessment of concomitant problems is still scarce.Main body: This review aims to identify the treatable traits of NTM pulmonary disease in people with CF and discuss the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in order to detect and manage all the clinical and behavioral aspects of the disease. The multidisciplinary complexity of NTM pulmonary disease in CF requires careful management of respiratory and extra-respiratory, including control of comorbidities, drug interactions and behavioral factors as adherence to therapies.Conclusions: The treatable trait strategy can help to optimize clinical management through systematic assessment of all the aspects of the disease, providing a holistic treatment for such a multi-systemic and complex condition.",38104098,PMC10725605,10.1186/s12931-023-02612-1,,2023,"Gramegna A, Misuraca S, Lombardi A, Premuda C, Barone I, Ori M, Amati F, Retucci M, Nazzari E, Alicandro G, Ferrarese M, Codecasa L, Bandera A, Aliberti S, Daccò V, Blasi F.",Y,MED
The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Receptor Brakes Allergic Airway Inflammation.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common autosomal recessive disease resulting from mutations of the gene that encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Although severe pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation is a primary pathologic feature of CF, more recent studies reveal a role for type 2 inflammation that is characterized by eosinophilia directed by both the innate and adaptive immune systems through ILC2 and CD4+ Th2 cells, respectively. We have published that a clear type endotype exists within CF subjects stratified by Th2 inflammation, defined by increased obstructive pulmonary disease and a distinct phenotypic signature of increased allergic disease, infections, and burden of CF complications. Further, we showed an increased risk of death among CF subjects with type 2 inflammatory signatures compared to CF subjects lacking significant type 2 inflammation. The mechanisms of this heightened type 2 inflammatory signature in CF are still being defined, but it is clear that airway epithelial cells from CFTR-deficient mice have increased expression and release of IL-33, a key activator of ILC2 and Th2 cells, compared to persons with normal CFTR function. Further, there is strong evidence that CF regulates CD4+ Th2 function in a cell-intrinsic fashion. These concepts are explored in this review article.",39981881,PMC11843850,10.1111/imr.70009,,2025,"Cook DP, Peebles RS.",Y,MED
Seasonal and climatic influence on respiratory infections in children with cystic fibrosis.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) and Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) are the predominant bacteria found in the airways of people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), significantly contributing to lung disease progression. While various factors influencing the initial acquisition (IA) of these pathogens are known, the impact of environmental conditions remains understudied. This epidemiological study assessed the risk of MSSA and Pa initial acquisitions in relation to seasonality and climatic zones among 1,184 French pwCF under 18 years old. The age at IA for Pa (Pa-IA) and MSSA (MSSA-IA) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Seasonality and climatic zones were analysed as risk factors using time-varying Cox regression models. The median age at MSSA-IA was notably earlier (2.0 years) than that at Pa-IA (5.1 years). MSSA-IA occurred increasingly younger in more recent birth cohorts, while the age at Pa-IA remained stable over time. The risk of Pa-IA was consistently higher in all seasons compared with spring, peaking in autumn (HR = 1.53), irrespective of climatic zones. In Oceanic and Continental climates, the highest risk for MSSA-IA was in winter (HRs = 1.45 and 1.20 respectively). In the Mediterranean climate, the risk of MSSA-IA was lower in winter compared to spring (HRs = 0.68 and 0.61 respectively), and the median age at MSSA-IA later than for Pa-IA. This study demonstrates that seasonality and meteorological factors may influence acquisition of MSSA and Pa in pwCF. These findings suggest that environmental factors play a role in pathogen acquisition dynamics in CF and could inform the development of preventive strategies.",39511324,PMC11543658,10.1038/s41598-024-77253-5,,2024,"Mésinèle J, Ruffin M, Guillot L, Boëlle PY, Corvol H, French CF Modifier Gene Study Investigators.",Y,MED
Cystic Fibrosis Bone Disease: The Interplay between CFTR Dysfunction and Chronic Inflammation.,"Cystic fibrosis is a monogenic disease with a multisystemic phenotype, ranging from predisposition to chronic lung infection and inflammation to reduced bone mass. The exact mechanisms unbalancing the maintenance of an optimal bone mass in cystic fibrosis patients remain unknown. Multiple factors may contribute to severe bone mass reduction that, in turn, have devastating consequences in the patients' quality of life and longevity. Here, we will review the existing evidence linking the CFTR dysfunction and cell-intrinsic bone defects. Additionally, we will also address how the proinflammatory environment due to CFTR dysfunction in immune cells and chronic infection impairs the maintenance of an adequate bone mass in CF patients.",36979360,PMC10046889,10.3390/biom13030425,,2023,"Fonseca Ó, Gomes MS, Amorim MA, Gomes AC.",Y,MED
The established chest MRI score for cystic fibrosis can be applied to contrast agent-free matrix pencil decomposition functional MRI: a multireader analysis.,"Background: Established morpho-functional chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detects abnormalities in lung morphology and perfusion in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) using a dedicated scoring system. Functional assessment is performed using contrast-enhanced (CE) perfusion MRI. Novel matrix pencil decomposition MRI (MP-MRI) is a contrast agent-free alternative, but further validation of this technique is needed.Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the validated morpho-functional chest MRI score for CE perfusion and MP perfusion MRI in a multireader approach.Methods: Twenty-seven pwCF (mean age 20.8 years, range 8.4-45.7 years) underwent morpho-functional MRI including CE perfusion and MP perfusion MRI in the same examination. Nine blinded chest radiologists of different experience levels assessed lung perfusion and applied the validated chest MRI score to CE- and MP-MRI. Inter-reader agreement of perfusion scores in CE- and MP-MRI were compared with each other and with the MRI morphology score. Differences according to the readers' experience were also analyzed.Results: The CE perfusion scores were overall lower than the MP perfusion scores (6.2 ± 3.3 vs. 6.9 ± 2.0; *p* < 0.05) with a strong correlation between both perfusion scores (*r* = 0.74; *p* < 0.01). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) as measure for inter-reader agreement was good and significant for both perfusion scores, but higher for the CE perfusion score (0.75, *p* < 0.001) than for MP perfusion scores (0.61, *p* < 0.001). The Bland-Altman analysis revealed a difference in CE and MP perfusion scores with more extreme values in CE perfusion scores compared to MP perfusion scores (*r* = 0.62, *p* < 0.001). The morphology score showed a moderate to good correlation with the CE perfusion score (*r* = 0.73, *p* < 0.01) and the MP perfusion score (*r* = 0.55, *p* < 0.01). We did not find a difference in scoring according to the radiological experience level.Conclusion: The established chest MRI score can be applied both to validated CE and novel MP perfusion MRI with a good interreader reliability. The remaining difference between CE and MP-MRI scores may be explained by a lack of routine in visual analysis of MP-MRI and may favor an automated analysis for use of MP-MRI as a noninvasive outcome measure.",40171501,PMC11958188,10.3389/fmed.2025.1527843,,2025,"Steinke E, Bauman G, Steffen IG, Schobert IT, Thee S, Syunyaeva Z, Roehmel J, Posch H, Fahlenkamp UL, Scale C, Veldhoen S, Bieri O, Wielpütz MO, Mall MA, Stahl M, Doellinger F.",Y,MED
Effects of insulin therapy optimization with sensor augmented pumps on glycemic control and body composition in people with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.,"Objective: Cystic fibrosis (CF)-related diabetes (CFRD) resulting from partial-to-complete insulin deficiency occurs in 40-50% of adults with CF. In people with CFRD, poor glycemic control leads to a catabolic state that may aggravate CF-induced nutritional impairment and loss of muscle mass. Sensor augmented pump (SAP) therapy may improve glycemic control as compared to multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy.Research design and methods: This non-randomized clinical trial was aimed at evaluating the effects of insulin therapy optimization with SAP therapy, combined with a structured educational program, on glycemic control and body composition in individuals with insulin-requiring CFRD. Of 46 participants who were offered to switch from MDI to SAP therapy, 20 accepted and 26 continued the MDI therapy. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were balanced between groups using a propensity score-based overlap weighting procedure and weighted mixed-effects regression models were used to estimate changes in study outcomes.Results: After 24 months changes in HbA1c were: -1.1% (-12.1 mmol/mol) (95% CI: -1.5; -0.8) and -0.1% (-1 mmol/mol) (95% CI: -0.5; 0.3) in the SAP and MDI therapy group, respectively, with a between-group difference of -1.0 (-10 mmol/mol) (-1.5; -0.5). SAP therapy was also associated with a decrease in mean glucose (between group difference: -32 mg/dL; 95% CI: -44; -20) and an increase in TIR (between group difference: 19.3%; 95% CI 13.9; 24.7) and in fat-free mass (between group difference: +5.5 Kg, 95% CI: 3.2; 7.8).Conclusion: Therapy optimization with SAP led to a significant improvement in glycemic control, which was associated with an increase in fat-free mass.",37720540,PMC10501717,10.3389/fendo.2023.1228153,,2023,"Grancini V, Alicandro G, Porcaro LL, Zazzeron L, Gramegna A, Morlacchi LC, Rossetti V, Gaglio A, Resi V, Daccò V, Blasi F, Orsi E.",Y,MED

Muco-Obstructive Lung Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Muco-obstructive lung disease is a new classification under the diseases of respiratory tract. A lot of discussion is still going on regarding this new group of diseases. It is characterised by obstruction of the respiratory tract with a thick mucin layer. Usually in normal individuals, the mucus is swept out of the respiratory system while coughing in the form of sputum or phlegm, but if the consistency of the mucus is thick, or the amount is heavy or there is a certain defect in the ciliary function of the respiratory tract, the mucus is not cleared and it gets accumulated in the lungs alveoli, therefore blocking it. The mucus trapped in the distal airways cannot be cleared by coughing therefore forming a layer in the alveoli and bronchioles. Long-standing condition causes inflammation and infection. This new group of diseases specifically includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). Asthma, although an obstructive disease of the lung, is not particularly included under muco-obstructive lung disease. The major symptoms with which these diseases present are sputum production, chronic cough and acute exacerbations of the condition. The mucus adheres to the lung parenchyma causing airway obstruction and hyperinflation. In this article, we will see how muco-obstructive lung diseases affect the normal physiology of the respiratory system and how is it different from other obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. We will individually look into all the four conditions that come under the category of muco-obstructive lung diseases.",37954759,PMC10637992,10.7759/cureus.46866,,2023,"Singh G, Acharya S, Shukla S, Jain D.",Y,MED
"Randomised, phase 1/2a trial of ION-827359, an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of ENaC.","Background: Hyperactivity of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) with increased sodium absorption is a feature of cystic fibrosis (CF). ION-827359 is a 2.5-generation antisense oligonucleotide targeted to reduce ENaC protein. This study evaluated ION-827359 safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.Methods: In this three-part phase 1/2a, double-blind, randomised study, healthy volunteers received single doses of placebo or ION-827359 (3, 10, 37.5 or 100 mg; Part 1) or multiple doses of placebo or ION-827359 (5×10 mg, 5×37.5 mg, 5×75 mg or 10×37.5 mg; Part 2). People with CF (pwCF) received multiple doses of placebo or ION-827359 (5×10 mg, 5×37.5 mg, 5×75 mg and 5×100 mg; Part 3). Treatments were administered *via* Pari eFlow© mesh nebuliser. The primary outcome was safety; pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were also assessed.Results: 64 healthy volunteers and 34 pwCF were enrolled. ION-827359 was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. There were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory values, ECG or vital signs. Systemic drug exposure was low (plasma half-life ∼2 weeks). Multiple doses of ION-827359 were associated with dose-dependent reductions in ENaC mRNA in bronchial epithelium. After multiple dosing, forced expiratory volume in 1 s was slightly higher in pwCF receiving ION-827359 (+2.9% with ION-827359 100 mg *versus* placebo; p=0.27).Conclusions: The tolerability and safety of ION-827359 appear favourable at this stage of investigation. Reduction in ENaC mRNA supports mechanistic efficacy at the doses and regimens tested, and supports further investigation of ION-827359 in pwCF.",39286058,PMC11403593,10.1183/23120541.00986-2023,,2024,"Sutharsan S, Fischer R, Gleiber W, Horsley A, Crosby J, Guo S, Xia S, Yu R, Newman KB, Elborn JS.",Y,MED
ROCK STUDY in CF: sustained anti-inflammatory effects of lumacaftor-ivacaftor in sputum and peripheral blood samples of adult patients with cystic fibrosis-an observational study.,"Background: Previous studies showed that the combination of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) corrector and potentiator, lumacaftor-ivacaftor (LUMA-IVA) provides meaningful clinical benefits in patients with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for the Phe508del *CFTR* mutation. However, little is known about the effect of LUMA-IVA on Proinflammatory Cytokines (PICs).Objectives: To investigate the impact of LUMA-IVA *CFTR* modulation on circulatory and airway cytokines before and after 12 months of LUMA-IVA treatment in a real-world setting.Methods: We assessed both plasma and sputum PICs, as well as standard clinical outcomes including Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) %predicted, Body Mass Index (BMI), sweat chloride and pulmonary exacerbations at baseline and prospectively for one year post commencement of LUMA-IVA in 44 patients with cystic fibrosis aged 16 years and older homozygous for the Phe508del *CFTR* mutation.Results: Significant reduction in plasma cytokines including interleukin (IL)-8 (p<0.05), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α (p<0.001), IL-1ß (p<0.001) levels were observed while plasma IL-6 showed no significant change (p=0.599) post-LUMA-IVA therapy. Significant reduction in sputum IL-6 (p<0.05), IL-8 (p<0.01), IL-1ß (p<0.001) and TNF-α (p<0.001) levels were observed after LUMA-IVA therapy. No significant change was noted in anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels in both plasma and sputum (p=0.305) and (p=0.585) respectively. Clinically significant improvements in FEV1 %predicted (mean+3.38%, p=0.002), BMI (mean+0.8 kg/m2, p<0.001), sweat chloride (mean -19 mmol/L, p<0.001), as well as reduction in intravenous antibiotics usage (mean -0.73, p<0.001) and hospitalisation (mean -0.38, p=0.002) were observed after initiation of LUMA-IVA therapy.Conclusion: This real-world study demonstrates that LUMA-IVA has significant and sustained beneficial effects on both circulatory and airway inflammation.

ERS International Congress 2022: highlights from the Paediatrics Assembly.,"This review has been prepared by the Early Career Members and Chairs of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Assembly 7: Paediatrics. We here summarise the highlights of the advances in paediatric respiratory research presented at the ERS International Congress 2022. The eight scientific groups of this Assembly cover a wide range of research areas, including respiratory physiology and sleep, asthma and allergy, cystic fibrosis (CF), respiratory infection and immunology, neonatology and intensive care, respiratory epidemiology, bronchology, and lung and airway developmental biology. Specifically, we report on abstracts presented at the congress on the effect of high altitude on sleep, sleep disorders, the hypoxic challenge test, and measurements of ventilation inhomogeneity. We discuss prevention of preschool wheeze and asthma, and new asthma medications. In children with CF, we describe how to monitor the effect of CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapy. We present respiratory manifestations and chronic lung disease associated with common variable immunodeficiency. Furthermore, we discuss how to monitor respiratory function in neonatal and paediatric intensive care units. In respiratory epidemiology, we present the latest news from population-based and clinical cohort studies. We also focus on innovative and interventional procedures for the paediatric airway, such as cryotherapy. Finally, we stress the importance of better understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying normal and abnormal lung development.",37228264,PMC10204827,10.1183/23120541.00653-2022,,2023,"Ardura-Garcia C, Kainz K, Mallet MC, Petrarca L, Rodman Berlot J, Slaats M, Streibel C, Vijverberg S, Williams EE, Goutaki M, Gray DM, Lavizzari A, Morty RE, Proesmans M, Schramm D, Stahl M, Zacharasiewicz A, Moeller A, Pijnenburg MW.",Y,MED

Socioeconomic burden of cystic fibrosis in Canada.,"Background: Cost of illness studies are important tools to summarise the burden of disease for individuals, the healthcare system and society. The lack of standardised methods for reporting costs for cystic fibrosis (CF) makes it difficult to quantify the total socioeconomic burden. In this study, we aimed to comprehensively report the socioeconomic burden of CF in Canada.Methods: The total cost of CF in Canada was calculated by triangulating information from three sources (Canadian CF Registry, customised Burden of Disease survey and publicly available information). A prevalence-based, bottom-up, human capital approach was applied, and costs were categorised into four perspectives (ie, healthcare system, individual/caregiver, variable (ie, medicines) and society) and three domains (ie, direct, indirect and intangible). All costs were converted into 2021 Canadian dollars (CAD) and adjusted for inflation. The cost of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies was excluded.Results: The total socioeconomic burden of CF in Canada in 2021 across the four perspectives was $C414 million. Direct costs accounted for two-thirds of the total costs, with medications comprising half of all direct costs. Out-of-pocket costs to individuals and caregivers represented 18.7% of all direct costs. Indirect costs representing absenteeism accounted for one-third of the total cost.Conclusion: This comprehensive cost of illness study for CF represents a community-oriented approach describing the socioeconomic burden of living with CF and serves as a benchmark for future studies.",39122474,PMC11331897,10.1136/bmjresp-2024-002309,,2024,"Laflamme OD, Johnson N, Steele K, Chavez L, Cheng SY, Rabin HR, Cheema ZM, Mamic E, Gomez LC, Leong J, Quon BS, Sadatsafavi M, Stephenson AL, Wranik WD, Eckford PDW, Wallenburg J, Bowerman C, Stanojevic S.",Y,MED
Real life evaluation of the multi-organ effects of Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor on F508del homozygous cystic fibrosis patients.,"Background: Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor (LUM-IVA), a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein corrector-potentiator combination, improves lung function and reduces pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) in F508del homozygous CF patients. However, the systemic effects of LUM-IVA outside the respiratory system have not yet been thoroughly investigated.Methods: A prospective, real-world, yearlong study was performed on F508del homozygous adult CF patients who commenced treatment with LUM-IVA. Pancreatic function, bone metabolism, fertility status, nutritional and pulmonary factors were evaluated.Results: Twelve patients, mean age 28.3 years (18.6-43.9) were recruited. Following 12 months of treatment, no changes were detected in glucose, insulin, c-peptide or BMI values. A significant relative decrease in mean alkaline-phosphatase levels (122.8 U/L vs 89.4, p = 0.002) and a trend toward an increase in calcium levels (9.5 vs 9.9 mg/dL, p = 0.074) were observed. A non-significant improvement in mean DEXA spine t-score after a year of treatment (-2.1 vs -1.6, n = 4, p = 0.11) was detected. Sweat chloride concentrations decreased significantly (-21.4 mEq/L; p = 0.003). Pulmonary outcome revealed improvement in spirometry values during the first three months (FEV1 by 5.7% p = 0.009, FEF25-75 by 4.3% p = 0.001) with no change in chest CT Bhalla score and CFQR after one year. There was also a significant decrease in parenteral antibiotic events (17 vs 8, p = 0.039) with shift from IV to oral antibiotics for PEx treatment.Conclusions: After one year of treatment, stabilization was observed in the pancreatic indices, nutritional status, structure and function of the lungs, with a beneficial effect on bone mineral metabolism and CFTR function.

Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of computed tomography changes in adults with cystic fibrosis treated with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor: a retrospective observational study.,"**Introduction:** The availability of highly effective triple *cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator* (*CFTR*) modulator combination therapy with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) has improved pulmonary outcomes and quality of life of people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). The aim of this study was to assess computed tomography (CT) changes under ETI visually with the Brody score and quantitatively with dedicated software, and to correlate CT measures with parameters of clinical response. **Methods:** Twenty two adult pwCF with two consecutive CT scans before and after ETI treatment initiation were retrospectively included. CT was assessed visually employing the Brody score and quantitatively by YACTA, a well-evaluated scientific software computing airway dimensions and lung parenchyma with wall percentage (WP), wall thickness (WT), lumen area (LA), bronchiectasis index (BI), lung volume and mean lung density (MLD) as parameters. Changes in CT metrics were evaluated and the visual and quantitative parameters were correlated with each other and with clinical changes in sweat chloride concentration, spirometry [percent predicted of forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1)] and body mass index (BMI). **Results:** The mean (SD) Brody score improved with ETI [55 (12) vs. 38 (15); *p* < 0.001], incl. sub-scores for mucus plugging, peribronchial thickening, and parenchymal changes (all *p* < 0.001), but not for bronchiectasis (*p* = 0.281). Quantitatve WP (*p* < 0.001) and WT (*p* = 0.004) were reduced, conversely LA increased (*p* = 0.003), and BI improved (*p* = 0.012). Lung volume increased (*p* < 0.001), and MLD decreased (*p* < 0.001) through a reduction of ground glass opacity areas (*p* < 0.001). Changes of the Brody score correlated with those of quantitative parameters, exemplarily WT with the sub-score for mucus plugging (r = 0.730, *p* < 0.001) and peribronchial thickening (r = 0.552, *p* = 0.008). Changes of CT parameters correlated with those of clinical response parameters, in particular ppFEV1 with the Brody score (r = -0.606, *p* = 0.003) and with WT (r = -0.538, *p* = 0.010). **Discussion:** Morphological treatment response to ETI can be assessed using the Brody score as well as quantitative CT parameters. Changes in CT correlated with clinical improvements.

Effects of Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor on Cystic Fibrosis Disease Progression in Children 2 through 5 Years of Age Homozygous for *F508del-CFTR*: A Phase 2 Placebo-controlled Clinical Trial.,"**Rationale:** Lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) was shown to be safe and well tolerated in children 2 through 5 years of age with cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygous for *F508del-CFTR* in a Phase 3 open-label study. Improvements in sweat chloride concentration, markers of pancreatic function, and lung clearance index2.5 (LCI2.5), along with increases in growth parameters, suggested the potential for early disease modification with LUM/IVA treatment. **Objective:** To further assess the effects of LUM/IVA on CF disease progression in children 2 through 5 years of age using chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). **Methods:** This Phase 2 study had two parts: a 48-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period in which children 2 through 5 years of age with CF homozygous for *F508del-CFTR* received either LUM/IVA or placebo (Part 1) followed by an open-label period in which all children received LUM/IVA for an additional 48 weeks (Part 2). The results from Part 1 are reported. The primary endpoint was absolute change from baseline in chest MRI global score at Week 48. Secondary endpoints included absolute change in LCI2.5 through Week 48 and absolute changes in weight-for-age, stature-for-age, and body mass index-for-age *z*-scores at Week 48. Additional endpoints included absolute changes in sweat chloride concentration, fecal elastase-1 levels, serum immunoreactive trypsinogen, and fecal calprotectin through Week 48. The primary endpoint was analyzed using Bayesian methods, where the actual Bayesian posterior probability of LUM/IVA being superior to placebo in the chest MRI global score at Week 48 was calculated using a vague normal prior distribution; secondary and additional endpoints were analyzed using descriptive summary statistics. **Results:** Fifty-one children were enrolled and received LUM/IVA (*n* = 35) or placebo (*n* = 16). For the change in chest MRI global score at Week 48, the Bayesian posterior probability of LUM/IVA being better than placebo (treatment difference, <0; higher score indicates greater abnormality) was 76%; the mean treatment difference was -1.5 (95% credible interval, -5.5 to 2.6). Treatment with LUM/IVA also led to within-group numerical improvements in LCI2.5, growth parameters, and biomarkers of pancreatic function as well as greater decreases in sweat chloride concentration compared with placebo from baseline through Week 48. Safety data were consistent with the established safety profile of LUM/IVA. **Conclusions:** This placebo-controlled study suggests the potential for early disease modification with LUM/IVA treatment, including that assessed by chest MRI, in children as young as 2 years of age.

Profiling the response to lumacaftor-ivacaftor in children with cystic between fibrosis and new insight from a French-Italian real-life cohort.,"Introduction: Clinical trials for CFTR modulators consider mean changes of clinical status at the cohort level, and thus fail to assess the heterogeneity of the response. We aimed to study the different response profiles to lumacaftor-ivacaftor according to age in children with cystic fibrosis (CF).Methods: A mathematical framework, including principal component analysis, data clustering, and data completion, was applied to a multicenter cohort of 112 children aged 6-18 years, treated with lumacaftor-ivacaftor. Studied parameters at baseline and 6 months included body mass index (BMI), number of days of antibiotics (ATB), Sweat test (ST), forced expiratory volume in 1 s expressed in percentage predicted (ppFEV1 ), forced vital capacity (ppFVC), and forced expiratory flow at 25%-75% of FVC (ppFEF25-75 ).Results: Change in ppFEV1 was the most significant parameter in characterizing response heterogeneity among the 12-18-year-old patients. Patients with minimal changes in ppFEV1 were further separated by change in BMI and ATB course. In the 6-12-year-old children both BMI and ppFEV1 evolution were the most relevant. ST change was not associated with a clinical response.Conclusions: Change in ppFEV1 , BMI, and ATB course are the most relevant outcomes to discriminate clinical response profiles in children treated with lumacaftor-ivacaftor.

"Brazilian guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of the pulmonary symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Official document of the Sociedade Brasileira de Pneumologia e Tisiologia (SBPT, Brazilian Thoracic Association).","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that results in dysfunction of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which is a chloride and bicarbonate channel expressed in the apical portion of epithelial cells of various organs. Dysfunction of that protein results in diverse clinical manifestations, primarily involving the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems, impairing quality of life and reducing life expectancy. Although CF is still an incurable pathology, the therapeutic and prognostic perspectives are now totally different and much more favorable. The purpose of these guidelines is to define evidence-based recommendations regarding the use of pharmacological agents in the treatment of the pulmonary symptoms of CF in Brazil. Questions in the Patients of interest, Intervention to be studied, Comparison of interventions, and Outcome of interest (PICO) format were employed to address aspects related to the use of modulators of this protein (ivacaftor, lumacaftor+ivacaftor, and tezacaftor+ivacaftor), use of dornase alfa, eradication therapy and chronic suppression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and eradication of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Burkholderia cepacia complex. To formulate the PICO questions, a group of Brazilian specialists was assembled and a systematic review was carried out on the themes, with meta-analysis when applicable. The results obtained were analyzed in terms of the strength of the evidence compiled, the recommendations being devised by employing the GRADE approach. We believe that these guidelines represent a major advance to be incorporated into the approach to patients with CF, mainly aiming to favor the management of the disease, and could become an auxiliary tool in the definition of public policies related to CF.",37194817,PMC10171269,10.36416/1806-3756/e20230040,,2023,"Athanazio RA, Tanni SE, Ferreira J, Dalcin PTR, Fuccio MB, Esposito C, Canan MGM, Coelho LS, Firmida MC, Almeida MB, Marostica PJC, Monte LFV, Souza EL, Pinto LA, Rached SZ, Oliveira VSB, Riedi CA, Silva Filho LVRFD.",Y,MED
Mapping the oxidative landscape in cystic fibrosis: methodological frontiers and application.,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF), a multi-organ disease stemming from CFTR gene mutations, is characterized by progressive pulmonary disease, chronic inflammation, and a pro-oxidative environment. The intricate relationship between CFTR dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation underscores the need to accurately characterize oxidative stress markers to identify therapeutic targets. This review compiles and analyzes methodologies employed in the CF field for this purpose, presenting selected applications and outcomes while highlighting potential inconsistencies due to experimental variations. The review encompasses a wide array of analytical techniques. These include methods for direct reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection (e.g., superoxide, hydrogen peroxide), characterization of oxidative damage to lipids (e.g., TBARS, F2-isoprostanes; lipidomics), proteins (e.g., carbonylation, S-nitrosylation, S-glutathionylation; proteomics), and DNA (e.g., 8-OHdG). Assays for major non-enzymatic antioxidants (glutathione, vitamins), enzymatic antioxidant systems (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) are detailed. Furthermore, methods to assess mitochondrial function for studying oxidative stress in CF are discussed. The critical choice of experimental models (*in vitro*, *in vivo*) and biological samples (e.g., blood, sputum, BALF, EBC, cells), along with their specific considerations, are also integral to the review. Application of these diverse methodologies frequently reveals heightened oxidative stress and perturbed antioxidant defenses across various CF-relevant compartments, although results can be influenced by the specific model or technique utilized. Ultimately, this comprehensive analysis underscores the complexity of assessing oxidative stress in CF and strongly advocates for the implementation of integrated, multiparametric strategies. Such synergistic approaches, combining complementary methodologies, are crucial for a holistic understanding of redox dysregulation, facilitating the identification of reliable biomarkers, and guiding the development of more effective, targeted antioxidant therapies to improve clinical outcomes in CF.",40740993,PMC12307221,10.3389/fphar.2025.1632924,,2025,"Rubin M, Artusi I, Cozza G.",Y,MED
Longitudinal improvements in clinical and functional outcomes following initiation of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Use of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) for treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) has resulted in unprecedented clinical improvements necessitating development of outcome measures for monitoring disease course. Intranasal micro-optical coherence tomography (μOCT) has previously helped detect and characterize mucociliary abnormalities in patients with CF. This study was done to determine if μOCT can define the effects of ETI on nasal mucociliary clearance and monitor changes conferred to understand mechanistic effects of CFTR modulators beyond CFTR activation.Methods: 26 subjects, with at least 1 F508del mutation were recruited and followed at baseline (visit 1), +1 month (visit 2) and +6 months (visit 4) following initiation of ETI therapy. Clinical outcomes were computed at visits 1, 2 and 4. Intranasal μOCT imaging and functional metrics analysis including mucociliary transport rate (MCT) estimation were done at visits 1 and 2.Results: Percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV1) showed a significant increase of +10.9 % at visit 2, which sustained at visit 4 (+10.6 %). Sweat chloride levels significantly decreased by -36.6 mmol/L and -41.3 mmol/L at visits 2 and 4, respectively. μOCT analysis revealed significant improvement in MCT rate (2.8 ± 1.5, visit 1 vs 4.0 ± 1.5 mm/min, visit 2; P = 0.048).Conclusions: Treatment with ETI resulted in significant and sustained clinical improvements over 6 months. Functional improvements in MCT rate were evident within a month after initiation of ETI therapy indicating that μOCT imaging is sensitive to the treatment effect of HEMT and suggests improved mucociliary transport as a probable mechanism of action underlying the clinical benefits.",38681615,PMC11052906,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e29188,,2024,"Vijaykumar K, Leung HM, Barrios A, Wade J, Hathorne HY, Nichols DP, Tearney GJ, Rowe SM, Solomon GM.",Y,MED
The effect of highly effective modulator therapy on systemic inflammation in cystic fibrosis,"ABSTRACT: Background: Despite significant clinical improvements, there is evidence of persisting airway inflammation in people with cystic fibrosis established on Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) therapy. As CF is a multi-system disease, systemic immune profiles can reflect local inflammation within the lungs and other organs. Understanding systemic inflammation after ETI therapy may reveal important translational insights. This study aims to profile systemic inflammatory changes and relate these to the well-documented improvements observed with ETI therapy. Methods: We conducted a single-centre longitudinal study with 57 CF subjects initiating ETI therapy. All participants were Phe508del homozygous or Phe508del/minimal function. Blood samples were collected pre-ETI and 3-12 months post-therapy initiation. Analyses included mass spectrometry-based proteomics, a multiplex immunoassay, and flow cytometry for peripheral immune cell counts and phenotype. Controls samples were provided by 29 age-matched healthy controls. Results: Systemic inflammation reduced with ETI therapy; however, the immune profile remained distinct from healthy controls. ETI reduced neutrophil counts and was associated with a more mature, less inflammatory phenotype, as well as a shift toward an immune resolving state associated with increased CD206 expression. Cytokines known to influence neutrophil levels reduced with therapy. Despite ETI therapy, neutrophil and monocyte counts remained elevated compared to healthy controls. There was no obvious association between the ETI-related improvements in systemic inflammation and lung function. Conclusions: Patients with CF show evidence of persisting systemic inflammation despite ETI therapy, this may have long term potentially adverse effects on respiratory and other organ systems.",,,10.1101/2024.07.25.24310916,,2024,"Maher RE, Cytlak-Chaudhuri U, Aleem S, Barry PJ, Brice D, Caamaño-Gutiérrez E, Driver K, Emmott E, Rothwell A, Smith E, Travis M, Lee D, McNamara PS, Waller I, Smith JA, Jones AM, Lord RW.",Y,PPR
The association between cystic fibrosis-related diabetes and periodontitis in adults: A pilot cross-sectional study.,"Objectives: Periodontitis is a highly prevalent complication of diabetes. However, the association between cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) and periodontitis has not yet been evaluated. The objective of this study was to assess if: 1) CFRD is associated with periodontitis among adults with CF, and 2) periodontitis prevalence differs by CF and diabetes status.Methods: This was a pilot cross-sectional study of the association between CFRD and periodontitis in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) (N = 32). Historical non-CF controls (N = 57) from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset were frequency matched to participants with CF on age, sex, diabetes status, and insulin use. We defined periodontitis using the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Periodontology (CDC/AAP) case definition, as the presence of two or more interproximal sites with CAL ≥3 mm and two or more interproximal sites with PD ≥4 mm (not on the same tooth) or one site with PD ≥5 mm. Because NHANES periodontal data were only available for adults ages ≥30 years, our analysis that included non-CF controls focused on this age group (CF N = 19, non-CF N = 57). Based on CF and diabetes status, we formed four groups: CFRD, CF and no diabetes, non-CF with diabetes, and non-CF and no diabetes (healthy). We used the Fisher's exact test for hypotheses testing.Results: There was no association between CFRD and periodontitis for participants with CF ages 22-63 years (CFRD 67% vs. CF no diabetes 53%, P = 0.49), this was also true for those ages ≥30 years (CFRD 78% vs. CF no diabetes 60%, P = 0.63). For the two CF groups, the prevalence of periodontitis was significantly higher than for healthy controls (CFRD 78% vs. healthy 7%, P<0.001; CF no diabetes 60% vs. healthy 7%, P = 0.001) and not significantly different than the prevalence for non-CF controls with diabetes (CFRD 78% vs. non-CF with diabetes 56%, P = 0.43; CF no diabetes 60% vs. non-CF with diabetes 56%, P = 0.99).Conclusion: Among participants with CF, CFRD was not associated with periodontitis. However, regardless of diabetes status, participants with CF had increased prevalence of periodontitis compared to healthy controls.",38917148,PMC11198763,10.1371/journal.pone.0305975,,2024,"Alkhateeb AA, Mancl LA, Ramos KJ, Rothen ML, Kotsakis GA, Trence DL, Chi DL.",Y,MED
"Case Report: When cystic fibrosis, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor therapy, and alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency get together.","In the last 10 years, the care of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been revolutionized with the introduction of *cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator* (CFTR) modulator drugs, with a major impact on symptoms and life expectancy, especially considering the newest and highly effective elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) therapy. Conversely, adverse effects are relatively frequent, with some being life-threatening, such as severe hepatitis. Clinical trials on children starting CFTR modulators have reported transaminase elevations >3× upper limit of the norm in 10%-20% of patients, whereas real-life studies have reported discontinuation rates three times higher than those observed in phase 3 trials. We report the case of a 10-year-old boy with CF who developed severe acute hepatitis 2 weeks after starting ELX/TEZ/IVA therapy. An extensive screening for potential causes led to the identification of heterozygous alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency with genotype MZ. The Z allele of *SERPINA1* gene, encoding AAT, is known as a risk factor for CF liver disease. We hypothesized that it may act as a risk factor for drug-induced liver injury from CFTR modulators, notably ELX/TEZ/IVA. Therefore, checking AAT before starting CFTR modulator therapy can be suggested, in particular for children with previous, even transient, liver disease.",38655277,PMC11035779,10.3389/fped.2024.1378744,,2024,"Kinuani R, Ezri J, Kernen Y, Rochat I, Blanchon S.",Y,MED
Functional Consequences of CFTR Interactions in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal autosomal recessive disorder caused by the loss of function mutations within a single gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR). CFTR is a chloride channel that regulates ion and fluid transport across various epithelia. The discovery of CFTR as the CF gene and its cloning in 1989, coupled with extensive research that went into the understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms of CF, have led to the development of revolutionary therapies in CF that we see today. The highly effective modulator therapies have increased the survival rates of CF patients and shifted the epidemiological landscape and disease prognosis. However, the differential effect of modulators among CF patients and the presence of non-responders and ineligible patients underscore the need to develop specialized and customized therapies for a significant number of patients. Recent advances in the understanding of the CFTR structure, its expression, and defined cellular compositions will aid in developing more precise therapies. As the lifespan of CF patients continues to increase, it is becoming critical to clinically address the extra-pulmonary manifestations of CF disease to improve the quality of life of the patients. In-depth analysis of the molecular signature of different CF organs at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels is rapidly advancing and will help address the etiological causes and variability of CF among patients and develop precision medicine in CF. In this review, we will provide an overview of CF disease, leading to the discovery and characterization of CFTR and the development of CFTR modulators. The later sections of the review will delve into the key findings derived from single-molecule and single-cell-level analyses of CFTR, followed by an exploration of disease-relevant protein complexes of CFTR that may ultimately define the etiological course of CF disease.",38542363,PMC10970640,10.3390/ijms25063384,,2024,"Ramananda Y, Naren AP, Arora K.",Y,MED
Ocular development after highly effective modulator treatment early in life.,"Highly effective cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies (HEMT), including elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor, correct the underlying molecular defect causing CF. HEMT decreases general symptom burden by improving clinical metrics and quality of life for most people with CF (PwCF) with eligible CFTR variants. This has resulted in more pregnancies in women living with CF. All HEMT are known to be able pass through the placenta and into breast milk in mothers who continue on this therapy while pregnant and breast feeding. Toxicity studies of HEMT in young rats demonstrated infant cataracts, and case reports have reported the presence of congenital cataracts in early life exposure to HEMT. This article reviews the evidence for how HEMT influences the dynamic and interdependent processes of healthy and abnormal lens development in the context of HEMT exposure during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and raises questions that remain unanswered.",37795027,PMC10547496,10.3389/fphar.2023.1265138,,2023,"Zhu Y, Li D, Reyes-Ortega F, Chinnery HR, Schneider-Futschik EK.",Y,MED

Modifier Factors of Cystic Fibrosis Phenotypes: A Focus on Modifier Genes.,"Although cystic fibrosis (CF) is recognized as a monogenic disease, due to variants within the *CFTR* (*Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator*) gene, an extreme clinical heterogeneity is described among people with CF (pwCF). Apart from the exocrine pancreatic status, most studies agree that there is little association between *CFTR* variants and disease phenotypes. Environmental factors have been shown to contribute to this heterogeneity, accounting for almost 50% of the variability of the lung function of pwCF. Nevertheless, pwCF with similar *CFTR* variants and sharing the same environment (such as in siblings) may have highly variable clinical manifestations not explained by *CFTR* variants, and only partly explained by environmental factors. It is recognized that genetic variants located outside the *CFTR* locus, named ""modifier genes"", influence the clinical expression of the disease. This short review discusses the latest studies that have described modifier factors associated with the various CF phenotypes as well as the response to the recent CFTR modulator therapies.",36430680,PMC9698440,10.3390/ijms232214205,,2022,"Mésinèle J, Ruffin M, Guillot L, Corvol H.",Y,MED
Early and sustained improvements of lung clearance index from two to sixteen weeks of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis-a real world study.,"Since the introduction of CFTR modulator therapies, longitudinal real-life data of lung clearance index (LCI) during treatment is scarce. In this single-centre, post-approval setting, we report data of 51 patients with different stages of lung disease, age 2-52 years with repeated measurements of forced expiratory volume as a percentage of the predicted value (ppFEV₁) and LCI after 2, 4, and 16 weeks of CFTR modulator treatment and at baseline. In 25 patients during elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) treatment, significant improvements of LCI (median -1.4) and ppFEV₁ (median +8.3%) were observed after only 2 weeks, and were maintained after 4 and 16 weeks of treatment (LCI: -2.0, -2.2; ppFEV₁: +7.2%, +11.8%). We observed a significant correlation between LCI improvement at week 16 and lower baseline LCI. In 26 younger and healthier patients receiving lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) treatment, no significant changes of LCI and ppFEV₁ occured. With ELX/TEZ/IVA, our data shows rapid, significant improvements of LCI and ppFEV₁ already after 2 weeks. Early LCI measurements can help to assess the patient's response to this high-cost therapy.",36969845,PMC10030732,10.3389/fphar.2023.1125853,,2023,"Appelt D, Steinkamp G, Sieber S, Ellemunter H.",Y,MED
Dry Powder Inhalation for Lung Delivery in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Pulmonary drug delivery has long been used for local and systemic administration of different medications used in acute and chronic respiratory diseases. Certain lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, rely heavily on chronic treatments, including targeted lung delivery. Pulmonary drug delivery possesses various physiological advantages compared to other delivery methods and is also convenient for the patient to use. However, the formulation of dry powder for pulmonary delivery proves challenging due to aerodynamic restrictions and the lower tolerance of the lung. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the respiratory tract structure in patients with cystic fibrosis, including during acute and chronic lung infections and exacerbations. Furthermore, this review discusses the advantages of targeted lung delivery, including the physicochemical properties of dry powder and factors affecting clinical efficacy.

Cystic fibrosis management in pediatric population-from clinical features to personalized therapy.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations of the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). In 1949, it's been identified as a monogenic disease and was thought to primarily affect individuals of Northern European descent. It was the most prevalent autosomal recessive disease that shortens life. With the availability of multiple testing methodologies nowadays, there is a chance to create novel and enhanced treatment options. Even in the absence of a high sweat chloride test (SCT) result, the discovery of two causal mutations is diagnostic for cystic fibrosis (CF). For a CF diagnosis, however, at least two positive E sweat chloride tests are still required. In order to achieve early and active intervention to manage cystic fibrosis (CF) and its comorbidities, treatment regimens for pediatric patients should be evaluated, improved, and closely monitored. New developments in the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) have led to the development of medications derived from molecules that target the pathogenetic pathway of the illness. These options are very efficient and allow pediatric patients to receive individualized care. However, in order to better direct patient care and enhance patient outcomes, it is crucial to research uncommon CF mutations, which can provide crucial information about the prognosis of the disease and the relationships between genotype and phenotype. To ensure the success of creating novel, safer, and more efficient treatment approaches, a deeper understanding of the pathogeny of the illness is required. In the age of customized medicine, genetic research will be essential to improving patient care and quality of life for those with uncommon mutations.",38798310,PMC11116730,10.3389/fped.2024.1393193,,2024,"Azoicai AN, Lupu A, Trandafir LM, Alexoae MM, Alecsa M, Starcea IM, Cuciureanu M, Knieling A, Salaru DL, Hanganu E, Mocanu A, Lupu VV, Ioniuc I.",Y,MED

"Organic Synthesis and Current Understanding of the Mechanisms of CFTR Modulator Drugs Ivacaftor, Tezacaftor, and Elexacaftor.","The monogenic rare disease Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance (CFTR) protein, an anion channel expressed at the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells. The discovery and subsequent development of CFTR modulators-small molecules acting on the basic molecular defect in CF-have revolutionized the standard of care for people with CF (PwCF), thus drastically improving their clinical features, prognosis, and quality of life. Currently, four of these drugs are approved for clinical use: potentiator ivacaftor (VX-770) alone or in combination with correctors lumacaftor, (VX-809), tezacaftor (VX-661), and elexacaftor (VX-445). Noteworthily, the triple combinatorial therapy composed of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor constitutes the most effective modulator therapy nowadays for the majority of PwCF. In this review, we exploit the organic synthesis of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor by providing a retrosynthetic drug analysis for these CFTR modulators. Furthermore, we describe the current understanding of the mechanisms of action (MoA's) of these compounds by discussing several studies that report the key findings on the molecular mechanisms underlying their action on the CFTR protein.",38398574,PMC10891718,10.3390/molecules29040821,,2024,"Ferreira FC, Buarque CD, Lopes-Pacheco M.",Y,MED
Current and Future Therapeutic Approaches of Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency in Children with Cystic Fibrosis in the Era of Personalized Medicine.,"This review presents current updates of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in children with cystic fibrosis based on literature published in the last decade and some special considerations regarding pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in the era of new therapies, such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapies. Few articles evaluate the efficacy of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in the pediatric population, and most studies also included children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Approximately 85% of cystic fibrosis patients have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and need pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. Fecal elastase is the most commonly used diagnostic test for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, although this value can fluctuate over time. While it is used as a diagnostic test, it cannot be used for monitoring the effectiveness of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and for adjusting doses. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, the actual treatment for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, is essential in children with cystic fibrosis to prevent malabsorption and malnutrition and needs to be urgently initiated. This therapy presents many considerations for physicians, patients, and their families, including types and timing of administration, dose monitoring, and therapy failures. Based on clinical trials, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is considered effective and well-tolerated in children with cystic fibrosis. An important key point in cystic fibrosis treatment is the recent hypothesis that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulators could improve pancreatic function, further studies being essential. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is addressed a complication of the disease (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency), while modulators target the defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in cystic fibrosis remains an active area of research in this era of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapies. This new therapy could represent an example of personalized medicine in cystic fibrosis patients, with each class of modulators being addressed to patients with specific genetic mutations.",36678791,PMC9862205,10.3390/pharmaceutics15010162,,2023,"Ritivoiu ME, Drăgoi CM, Matei D, Stan IV, Nicolae AC, Craiu M, Dumitrescu IB, Ciolpan AA.",Y,MED
Heterogeneity of weight gain after initiation of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor in people with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: The introduction of the novel therapy, Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI) has been effective in improving weight gain in both clinical trials and real-world studies. However, the magnitude of this effect appears to be heterogeneous across patient subgroups. This study aims to identify potential determinants of heterogeneity in weight gain following 6-month ETI therapy.Methods: We conducted a multicenter, prospective cohort study enrolling 92 adults with CF at two major CF centers in Italy with follow-up visit at one month and six months from ETI initiation. The treatment's effect on weight changes was evaluated using mixed effect regression models that included subject-specific random intercepts and fixed effects for potential predictors of treatment response, time and a predictor-by-time interaction term.Results: The mean weight gain at six months from the start of treatment was 4.6 kg (95% CI: 2.3-6.9) for the 10 patients with underweight, 3.2 kg (95% CI: 2.3-4.0) for the 72 patients with normal weight, and 0.7 kg (95% CI: -1.6-3.0) for the 10 patients with overweight. After six months of ETI treatment, 8 (80%) of the patients with underweight transitioned to the normal weight category, while 11 (15.3%) of the normal-weight patients became overweight. The major determinants of heterogeneity in weight gain were the baseline BMI and the presence of at least one CFTR residual function mutation, explaining 13% and 8% of the variability, respectively.Conclusions: Our results indicate that ETI is highly effective in improving weight gain in underweight subjects with CF. However, our data also suggests the need for close monitoring of excess weight gain to prevent potential cardiometabolic complications.",37330504,PMC10276411,10.1186/s12931-023-02451-0,,2023,"Gramegna A, Majo F, Alicandro G, Leonardi G, Cristiani L, Amati F, Contarini M, Aliberti S, Fiocchi AG, Blasi F.",Y,MED
Leukocyte telomere length and attrition in association with disease severity in cystic fibrosis patients.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by chronic airway inflammation and premature aging. The link with leukocyte telomere length (LTL) as a marker of biological aging is unclear. We studied disease severity and LTL in 168 CF patients of which 85 patients had a second retrospective LTL assessment. A higher FEV1 was associated with longer LTL, with a stronger effect in men (5.08% longer LTL) compared to women (0.41% longer LTL). A higher FEV1/FVC ratio was associated with 7.05% (*P*=0.017) longer LTL in men. CF asthma, as defined by the treatment with inhaled corticosteroids, was associated with -6.65% shorter LTL (*P*=0.028). Men homozygous for the ΔF508 genotype showed a -10.48% (*P*=0.026) shorter LTL compared to heterozygotes. A genotype-specific non-linear association between LTL shortening and chronological age was observed. Stronger age-related LTL shortening was observed in patients homozygous for the ΔF508 genotype (*P*-interaction= 0.044). This work showed that disease severity in CF patients negatively influences LTL, with slightly more pronounced effects in men. The homozygous genotype for ΔF508 may play a role in LTL attrition in CF patients. Understanding factors in CF patients that accelerate biological aging provides insights into mechanisms that can extend the overall life quality in CF-diseased.",39213174,PMC11386922,10.18632/aging.206093,,2024,"Martens DS, Lammertyn EJ, Goeminne PC, Colpaert K, Proesmans M, Vanaudenaerde BM, Nawrot TS, Dupont LJ.",Y,MED
Drug treatment of cystic fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive condition in Australia. A defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein affects chloride transport across epithelial cells. Patients with cystic fibrosis produce thick sticky mucus. This causes problems in multiple organs, particularly the lungs. Cystic fibrosis modulator therapies can partially correct the underlying pathophysiology and improve chloride transport, thereby improving morbidity. Life expectancy is improving, so many patients are now developing chronic diseases associated with ageing. All health professionals should be aware that the cystic fibrosis modulator therapies are metabolised via cytochrome P450 pathways in the liver. There are therefore significant drug-drug interactions with medicines metabolised by the same pathways.",36382177,PMC9584790,10.18773/austprescr.2022.063,,2022,"Bruorton M, Goddard T.",Y,MED
Role of inhaled antibiotics in the era of highly effective CFTR modulators.,"Recurrent and chronic bacterial infections are common in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and contribute to lung function decline. Antibiotics are the mainstay in the treatment of exacerbations and chronic bacterial infection in CF. Inhaled antibiotics are effective in treating chronic respiratory bacterial infections and eradicating *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* from the respiratory tract, with limited systemic adverse effects. In the past decade, highly effective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators have become a new therapy that partially corrects/opens chloride transport in patients with selected CFTR mutations, restoring mucus hydration and improving mucociliary clearance. The recent triple CFTR modulator combination is approved for ∼80-90% of the CF population and significantly reduces pulmonary exacerbations and improves respiratory symptoms and lung function. CFTR modulators have shifted the focus from symptomatic treatment to personalised/precision medicine by targeting genotype-specific CFTR defects. While these are highly effective, they do not fully normalise lung physiology, stop inflammation or resolve chronic lung damage, such as bronchiectasis. The impact of these new drugs on lung health is likely to change the future management of chronic pulmonary infections in people with CF. This article reviews the role of inhaled antibiotics in the era of CFTR modulators.",36631132,PMC9879329,10.1183/16000617.0154-2022,,2023,"Elborn JS, Blasi F, Burgel PR, Peckham D.",Y,MED
Long-term effects of lumacaftor/ivacaftor on paranasal sinus abnormalities in children with cystic fibrosis detected with magnetic resonance imaging.,"**Introduction:** Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) usually presents with nasal congestion, rhinorrhea and anosmia impacts quality of life in cystic fibrosis (CF). Especially mucopyoceles pathognomonic for CRS in CF may cause complications such as spread of infection. Previous studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated early onset and progression of CRS from infancy to school age in patients with CF, and mid-term improvements of CRS in preschool and school-age children with CF treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor for at least 2 months. However, long-term data on treatment effects on paranasal sinus abnomalities in preschool and school-age children with CF are lacking. **Methods:** 39 children with CF homozygous for F508del (mean age at baseline MRI 5.9 ± 3.0 years, range 1-12 years) underwent MRI before (MRI1) and about 7 months after starting lumacaftor/ivacaftor and then annually (median 3 follow-up MRI, range 1-4) (MRI2-4). MRI were evaluated using the previously evaluated CRS-MRI score with excellent inter-reader agreement. For intraindividual analysis ANOVA mixed-effects analysis including Geisser-Greenhouse correction and Fisher's exact test, and for interindividual group analysis Mann-Whitney test were used. **Results:** The CRS-MRI sum score at baseline was similar in children starting lumacaftor/ivacaftor in school age and children starting therapy at preschool age (34.6 ± 5.2 vs.32.9 ± 7.8, *p* = 0.847). Mucopyoceles were the dominant abnormality in both, especially in maxillary sinus (65% and 55%, respectively). In children starting therapy in school age the CRS-MRI sum score decreased longitudinally from MRI1 to MRI2 (-2.1 ± 3.5, *p* < 0.05), MRI3 (-3.0 ± 3.7, *p* < 0.01) and MRI4 (-3.6 ± 4.7, *p* < 0.01), mainly due to a decrease in the mucopyoceles subscore (-1.0 ± 1.5, *p* = 0.059; -1.2 ± 2.0, *p* < 0.05; -1.6 ± 1.8, *p* < 0.01; and -2.6 ± 2.8, *p* = 0.417, respectively). In children starting lumacaftor/ivacaftor in preschool age, the CRS-MRI sum score remained stable under therapy over all three follow-up MRI (0.6 ± 3.3, *p* = 0.520; 2.4 ± 7.6, *p* = 0.994; 2.1 ± 10.5, *p* > 0.999 and -0.5 ± 0.5, *p* = 0.740; respectively). **Conclusion:** Longitudinal paranasal sinus MRI shows improvements in paranasal sinus abnormalities in children with CF starting lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy at school age. Further, MRI detects a prevention of an increase in paranasal sinus abnormalities in children with CF starting lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy at preschool age. Our data support the role of MRI for comprehensive non-invasive therapy and disease monitoring of paranasal sinus abnormalities in children with CF.",37101549,PMC10123276,10.3389/fphar.2023.1161891,,2023,"Wucherpfennig L, Wuennemann F, Eichinger M, Seitz A, Baumann I, Stahl M, Graeber SY, Zhao S, Chung J, Schenk JP, Alrajab A, Kauczor HU, Mall MA, Sommerburg O, Wielpütz MO.",Y,MED
Factors Predisposing the Response to Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor in People with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUMA-IVA) therapy is prescribed to people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) homozygous for the Phe508del-*CFTR* variant to restore CFTR protein function. There is, however, large inter-individual variability in treatment response. Here, we seek to identify clinical and/or genetic factors that may modulate the response to this CFTR modulator therapy. A total of 765 pwCF older than 12 years under LUMA-IVA therapy and with lung function and nutritional measurements available before and after treatment initiation were included. Response to treatment was determined by the change in lung function and nutritional status, from baseline and over the first two years after initiation, and it was assessed by weighted generalized estimating equation models. Gains in lung function and nutritional status were observed after 6 months of treatment (on average 2.11 ± 7.81% for percent predicted FEV1 and 0.44 ± 0.77 kg/m2 for BMI) and sustained over the 2 years. We observed that the more severe patients gained the most in lung function and nutritional status. While females started with a nutritional status more impaired than males, they had a larger response and regained BMI Z-score values similar to men after 2 years of treatment. We observed no association between variants in solute carrier (*SLC*) genes and the respiratory function response to LUMA-IVA, but the *SLC6A14* rs12839137 variant was associated with the nutritional response. Further investigations, including other genomic regions, will be needed to fully explore the inter-individual variability of the response to LUMA-IVA.",35207740,PMC8876860,10.3390/jpm12020252,,2022,"Mésinèle J, Ruffin M, Guillot L, Boëlle PY, Corvol H, On Behalf Of The French Cf Modifier Gene Study Investigators.",Y,MED
"Polish Cystic Fibrosis Patients' Health-Related Quality of Life and Its Influencing Factors: A Cross-Sectional, Single-Centre Study.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease characterized by long-term and troublesome symptoms that affect the patient's life. This study aimed to assess and compare the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of Polish CF patients and identify factors influencing it. The study group consisted of 79 patients (6 to 42 years old), who filled in an age-appropriate Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised. Medical data were collected from each patient's medical records. The domains with the highest HRQoL median were eating problems (88.89), digestive symptoms (77.78) and physical functioning (75.00). The lowest-rated domain was social functioning (61.90). Age negatively correlated with eight domains, and most strongly with treatment burden (rho = -0.474). Physical functioning positively correlated with all spirometry parameters, and most strongly with FEV1% (rho = 0.588). Treatment burden, body image and respiratory symptoms were positively correlated with all spirometry parameters except PEF%. Present exacerbations reduced scores in almost all domains, and in the MANCOVA model they were a significant factor differentiating patients' HRQoL. The univariate analysis of MANCOVA showed the significant effects of both health condition (F = 8.32, *p* = 0.005) and the COVID-19 pandemic (F = 5.89, *p* = 0.018) on social functioning domain, and of the place of residence on body image (F = 5.60, *p* = 0.21). A decreasing HRQoL with increasing age and during exacerbations indicates that it is important to focus on these aspects of patients' lives and ensure they received the necessary support from their healthcare providers.",38921297,PMC11204049,10.3390/healthcare12121183,,2024,"Humaj-Grysztar M, Rachel M, Bonior J.",Y,MED
Contrast agent-free functional magnetic resonance imaging with matrix pencil decomposition to quantify abnormalities in lung perfusion and ventilation in patients with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Previous studies showed that contrast-enhanced (CE) morpho-functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detects abnormalities in lung morphology and perfusion in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Novel matrix pencil decomposition MRI (MP-MRI) enables quantification of lung perfusion and ventilation without intravenous contrast agent administration.Objectives: To compare MP-MRI with established morpho-functional MRI and spirometry in patients with CF.Methods: Thirty-nine clinically stable patients with CF (mean age 21.6 ± 10.7 years, range 8-45 years) prospectively underwent morpho-functional MRI including CE perfusion MRI, MP-MRI and spirometry. Two blinded chest radiologists assessed morpho-functional MRI and MP-MRI employing the validated chest MRI score. In addition, MP-MRI data were processed by automated software calculating perfusion defect percentage (QDP) and ventilation defect percentage (VDP).Results: MP perfusion score and QDP correlated strongly with the CE perfusion score (both *r* = 0.81; *p* < 0.01). MP ventilation score and VDP showed strong inverse correlations with percent predicted FEV1 (*r* = -0.75 and *r* = -0.83; *p* < 0.01). The comparison of visual and automated parameters showed that both MP perfusion score and QDP, and MP ventilation score and VDP were strongly correlated (*r* = 0.74 and *r* = 0.78; both *p* < 0.01). Further, the MP perfusion score and MP ventilation score, as well as QDP and VDP were strongly correlated (*r* = 0.88 and *r* = 0.86; both *p* < 0.01).Conclusion: MP-MRI detects abnormalities in lung perfusion and ventilation in patients with CF without intravenous or inhaled contrast agent application, and correlates strongly with the well-established CE perfusion MRI score and spirometry. Automated analysis of MP-MRI may serve as quantitative noninvasive outcome measure for diagnostic monitoring and clinical trials.",38903825,PMC11188455,10.3389/fmed.2024.1349466,,2024,"Doellinger F, Bauman G, Roehmel J, Stahl M, Posch H, Steffen IG, Pusterla O, Bieri O, Wielpütz MO, Mall MA.",Y,MED
Metagenomics Applied to the Respiratory Mycobiome in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder characterized by chronic microbial colonization and inflammation of the respiratory tract (RT), leading to pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) and lung damage. Although the lung bacterial microbiota has been extensively studied, the mycobiome remains understudied. However, its importance as a contributor to CF pathophysiology has been highlighted. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the mycobiome, as described through NGS-based studies, in patients with CF (pwCF).Several studies have demonstrated that the mycobiome in CF lungs is a dynamic entity, exhibiting a lower diversity and abundance than the bacterial microbiome. Nevertheless, the progression of lung damage is associated with a decrease in fungal and bacterial diversity. The core mycobiome of the RT in pwCFs is mainly composed of yeasts (Candida spp., Malassezia spp.) and molds with lower abundance. Some fungi (Aspergillus, Scedosporium/Pseudallescheria) have been demonstrated to play a role in PEx, while the involvement of others (Candida, Pneumocystis) remains uncertain. The ""climax attack"" ecological model has been proposed to explain the complexity and interplay of microbial populations in the RT, leading to PEx and lung damage. NGS-based studies also enable the detection of intra- and interkingdom correlations between fungi and bacteria. Further studies are required to ascertain the biological and pathophysiological relevance of these correlations. Finally, with the recent advent of CFTR modulators, our understanding of the pulmonary microbiome and mycobiome in pwCFs is about to change.",39264513,PMC11392981,10.1007/s11046-024-00887-6,,2024,"Angebault C, Botterel F.",Y,MED
Sex differences in airway disease: estrogen and airway surface liquid dynamics.,"Biological sex differences exist for many airway diseases in which females have either worse or better health outcomes. Inflammatory airway diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and asthma display a clear male advantage in post-puberty while a female benefit is observed in asthma during the pre-puberty years. The influence of menstrual cycle stage and pregnancy on the frequency and severity of pulmonary exacerbations in CF and asthma point to a role for sex steroid hormones, particularly estrogen, in underpinning biological sex differences in these diseases. There are many ways by which estrogen may aggravate asthma and CF involving disturbances in airway surface liquid (ASL) dynamics, inappropriate hyper-immune and allergenic responses, as well as exacerbation of pathogen virulence. The deleterious effect of estrogen on pulmonary function in CF and asthma contrasts with the female advantage observed in airway diseases characterised by pulmonary edema such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19. Airway surface liquid hypersecretion and alveolar flooding are hallmarks of ARDS and COVID-19, and contribute to the morbidity and mortality of severe forms of these diseases. ASL dynamics encompasses the intrinsic features of the thin lining of fluid covering the airway epithelium which regulate mucociliary clearance (ciliary beat, ASL height, volume, pH, viscosity, mucins, and channel activating proteases) in addition to innate defence mechanisms (pathogen virulence, cytokines, defensins, specialised pro-resolution lipid mediators, and metabolism). Estrogen regulation of ASL dynamics contributing to biological sex differences in CF, asthma and COVID-19 is a major focus of this review.",39026347,PMC11264786,10.1186/s13293-024-00633-z,,2024,"Harvey BJ, McElvaney NG.",Y,MED
One year effect of tezacaftor and ivacaftor on functional exercise capacity and muscle strength in people with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: The 1-min sit-to-stand test (1STST) is a practical tool to evaluate physical capacity. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of tezacaftor and ivacaftor on functional exercise capacity, muscle strength and symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF).Methods: The assessments were performed during the first year of tezacaftor and ivacaftor using the 1STST, 6-min walk test (6MWT), MicroFET2 dynamometer®, CF Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R), Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ). Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), body mass index (BMI), pancreatic sufficiency status, genotype and microbiologic data were also collected.Results: Fifty-four PwCF participated to the study and took at least one dose of tezacaftor-ivacaftor. Mean age was 26y±10 (±SD), median BMI 20.9 kg/m2 (interquartile range) (19.4; 23.5) and mean FEV1 82 percent of predicted values (%PV) ± 21. Significant correlations were found at baseline between the 1STST and the 6MWT (r = 0.617, p < 0.0001), the quadriceps strength (r = 0.6556, p < 0.0001) and the FEV1 (r = 0.29, p = 0.03). After one year of treatment, the 1STST increased significantly in terms of number of repetitions (n) (median 50 versus 58.5, p < 0.0001), %PV (101.1 versus 115.2%PV, p = 0.0003) and n times weight in kg (2885 versus 3389nxkg, p < 0.0001). The 6MWT distance and quadriceps strength were not modified after treatment but during the 6MWT, oxygen desaturation decreased significantly. FEV1, BMI, CFQ-R, LCQ improved as previously demonstrated.Conclusion: After one year of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, the 1STST improves, suggesting that the 1STST seems more responsive than the 6MWT and the MicroFET2 dynamometer® to assess the effects of CFTR modulators.",38434346,PMC10907658,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e26729,,2024,"Anne-Sophie A, Penelle M, Clémence G, Berardis S, Goubau C, Reychler G, Gohy S.",Y,MED
Emulated trial investigating effects of multiple treatments: estimating combined effects of mucoactive nebulisers in cystic fibrosis using registry data.,"Introduction: People with cystic fibrosis (CF) are often on multiple long-term treatments, including mucoactive nebulisers. In the UK, the most common mucoactive nebuliser is dornase alfa (DNase). A common therapeutic approach for people already on DNase is to add hypertonic saline (HS). The effects of DNase and HS used alone have been studied in randomised trials, but their effects in combination have not. This study investigates whether, for people already prescribed DNase, adding HS has additional benefit for lung function or use of intravenous antibiotics.Methods: Using UK CF Registry data from 2007 to 2018, we emulated a target trial. We included people aged 6 years and over who were prescribed DNase without HS for 2 years. We investigated the effects of combinations of DNase and HS over 5 years of follow-up. Inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting was used to control confounding. The period predated triple combination CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators in routine care.Results: 4498 individuals were included. At baseline, average age and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1%) predicted were 21.1 years and 69.7 respectively. During first year of follow-up, 3799 individuals were prescribed DNase alone; 426 added HS; 57 switched to HS alone and 216 were prescribed neither. We found no evidence that adding HS improved FEV1% at 1-5 years, or use of intravenous antibiotics at 1-4 years, compared with DNase alone.Conclusion: For individuals with CF prescribed DNase, we found no evidence that adding HS had an effect on FEV1% or prescription of intravenous antibiotics. Our study illustrates the emulated target trial approach using CF Registry data.",37451864,PMC10511967,10.1136/thorax-2023-220031,,2023,"Granger E, Davies G, Keogh RH.",Y,MED
"Individualized approach to elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor dosing in cystic fibrosis, in response to self-reported anxiety and neurocognitive adverse events: A case series.","The prevalence of mental health disorders is high among people with Cystic Fibrosis. The psychological symptoms in CF are associated with poor adherence, worse treatment outcomes, and greater health utilization/cost. Mental health and neurocognitive Adverse Events (AEs) have been reported with all available Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) modulators in small groups of patients. We report our experience with a dose reduction strategy in 10 of our patients on elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (7.9% of total number of patients) who self-reported developing intense anxiety, irritability, sleep disturbance and/or mental slowness after initiation of full dose treatment. Standard dose elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor resulted in 14.3 points improvement in mean Percent Predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s (ppFEV1), and a mean difference in sweat chloride of -39.3 mmol/L. We initially discontinued and/or reduced therapy according to the AEs severity, with a subsequent planned dose escalation every 4-6 weeks guided by sustainability of clinical effectiveness, absence of AEs recurrence, and patients' preferences. Clinical parameters including lung function and sweat chloride were monitored for up to 12 weeks to assess ongoing clinical response to the reduced dose regimen. Dose reduction resulted in resolution of self-reported mental/psychological AEs, without loss of clinical effectiveness (ppFEV1 was 80.7% on standard dose, and 83.4% at 12 weeks on reduced dose; sweat chloride was 33.4 and 34 mmol/L on standard and reduced dose, respectively). Furthermore, in a subgroup of patients who completed 24 weeks of the reduced dose regimen, repeat low dose Computed Tomography imaging showed a significant response when compared to pre-initiation of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor.",37180712,PMC10172465,10.3389/fphar.2023.1156621,,2023,"Ibrahim H, Danish H, Morrissey D, Deasy KF, McCarthy M, Dorgan J, Fleming C, Howlett C, Twohig S, Vagg T, Murphy DM, Maher M, Plant BJ.",Y,MED
Impact of CFTR Modulators on Beta-Cell Function in Children and Young Adults with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Background: To date, no consistent data are available on the possible impact of CFTR modulators on glucose metabolism. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that treatment with CFTR modulators is associated with an improvement in the key direct determinants of glucose regulation in children and young adults affected by Cystic Fibrosis (CF).Methods: In this study, 21 CF patients aged 10-25 underwent oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) before and after 12-18 months of treatment with Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor or Elexacaftor-Ivacaftor-Tezacaftor. β-cell function (i.e., first and second phase of insulin secretion measured as derivative and proportional control, respectively) and insulin clearance were estimated by OGTT mathematical modelling. Insulin sensitivity was estimated by the Oral Glucose Sensitivity Index (OGIS). The dynamic interplay between β-cell function, insulin clearance and insulin sensitivity was analysed by vector plots of glucose-stimulated insulin bioavailability vs. insulin sensitivity.Results: No changes in glucose tolerance occurred after either treatment, whereas a significant improvement in pulmonary function and chronic bacterial infection was observed. Beta cell function and insulin clearance did not change in both treatment groups. Insulin sensitivity worsened in the Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor group. The analysis of vector plots confirmed that glucose regulation was stable in both groups.Conclusions: Treatment of CF patients with CFTR modulators does not significantly ameliorate glucose homeostasis and/or any of its direct determinants.",35887914,PMC9319690,10.3390/jcm11144149,,2022,"Piona C, Mozzillo E, Tosco A, Volpi S, Rosanio FM, Cimbalo C, Franzese A, Raia V, Zusi C, Emiliani F, Boselli ML, Trombetta M, Bonadonna RC, Cipolli M, Maffeis C.",Y,MED
Optimizing CFTR modulator therapy management for cystic fibrosis through the ReX platform.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic multi-systemic disease that requires a complex daily treatment regimen. Therefore, there is sub-optimal adherence to CF therapies, and it was shown to impact its clinical and economic burden. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulators (CFTRm) are high-cost medications that demonstrated significant benefit in clinical trials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety, usability, and efficacy of the ReX platform in medication management of CFTRm for the treatment of people with CF (pwCF).Methods: ReX is a patient engagement platform consisting of a cloud-based management system and a cell-enabled handheld device intended to dispense oral medication into the patient's mouth, following a pre-programmed treatment protocol. It provides real-time adherence data to caregivers and timely, personalized reminders to patients. This is a prospective multi-center open study for pwCFs older than 12 years, who had been prescribed CFTRm [elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) or tezacaftor/ivacaftor (TI)], and provided consent to use ReX platform to receive CFTRm and record their health condition. Study duration was 12-24 months, with clinic visits where physical examination, body mass index (BMI), and pulmonary function tests were performed, and user experience questionnaires were filled in.Results: Ten pwCFs from two CF centers in Israel were included. The mean age was 31.5 years (range 15-74 years); eight were taking ETI and two TI. Median adherence to CFTRm was 97.5% (range 70%-100%) in the first year and 94% (range 84%-99%) in the second year, which is higher than the previously reported CFTRm adherence of ∼80%. No adverse events related to the use of the platform were reported. Patients reported ReX to be valuable to their treatment management and user friendly. Estimated mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1%) increased from 74.4% to 80.8% (*p* = 0.004) over 2 years. Similarly, estimated BMI percentile increased from 53.5 to 59.0 (*p* < 0.001).Conclusions: Using the ReX platform in medication management of pwCF treated by CFTRm is safe, easy to use, and effective in improving the adherence to treatment and the clinical outcomes. Consequently, this device may potentially reduce costs to healthcare providers. Further larger and long-term studies are required to examine the clinical benefits of the ReX platform.",38178914,PMC10766369,10.3389/fped.2023.1300968,,2023,"Yaacoby-Bianu K, Cohen-Cymberknoh M, Shoseyov D, Lavi T, Ostrovski A, Shteinberg M, Livnat G.",Y,MED
The relationship between weight and pulmonary outcomes in overweight and obese people with cystic fibrosis: A retrospective observational study.,"Background: A major focus in cystic fibrosis (CF) care aims to increase weight gain. Rates of overweight and obese people with CF have gradually increased over the past decade. Obesity could be a risk for restriction of lung volumes and airway obstruction as well as increase rates of pulmonary exacerbations in people with CF.Aim: To assess the relationship between weight categories and pulmonary outcomes in children and adults with CF.Methods: Patients 6 years of age and older were categorized into weight categories based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definitions. A retrospective chart review was conducted to obtain lung function testing and other outcomes.Results: One hundred five patients with a median age of 20.6 years were included in this analysis. 8.4%, 64%, 18%, and 10% of patients were underweight, normal/healthy weight, overweight, and obese, respectively. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (% predicted) did not differ between patients with weights in the normal range versus patients in the overweight/obese categories. Linear regression analysis showed a direct correlation between body mass index (BMI) and FEV1 that continued as BMI entered overweight and obese categories in both pediatric and adult patients. Overweight/obese patients did not have increased rates of pulmonary exacerbations compared to those in the normal/healthy weight category.Conclusion: As CF therapies continue to improve, an increasing number of people with CF are exceeding the CDC's normal-weight range. Gaining weight past the normal range does not appear to negatively impact pulmonary health of people with CF. If this trend of increased weight gain continues, it remains to be seen if it will eventually negatively affect lung health.",36320654,PMC9616171,10.1002/hsr2.910,,2022,"Welter JJ, Lennox AT, Krishnan S, Kim C, Krishnan S, Thompson H, McAllister E, Huang K, Nwaedozie K, Dozor AJ.",Y,MED
Anti-inflammatory effects of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in adults with cystic fibrosis heterozygous for F508del.,"Inflammation is a key driver in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF). We assessed the effectiveness of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) therapy on downregulating systemic and immune cell-derived inflammatory cytokines. We also monitored the impact of ETI therapy on clinical outcome. Adults with CF, heterozygous for F508del (n = 19), were assessed at baseline, one month and three months following ETI therapy, and clinical outcomes were measured, including sweat chloride, lung function, weight, neutrophil count and C-reactive protein (CRP). Cytokine quantifications were measured in serum and following stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate and analysed using LEGEND plex™ Human Inflammation Panel 1 by flow cytometry (n = 19). ASC specks were measured in serum and caspase-1 activity and mRNA levels determined from stimulated PBMCs were determined. Patients remained stable over the study period. ETI therapy resulted in decreased sweat chloride concentrations (p < 0.0001), CRP (p = 0.0112) and neutrophil count (p = 0.0216) and increased percent predicted forced expiratory volume (ppFEV1) (p = 0.0399) from baseline to three months, alongside a trend increase in weight. Three months of ETI significantly decreased IL-18 (p< 0.0011, p < 0.0001), IL-1β (p<0.0013, p = 0.0476), IL-6 (p = 0.0109, p = 0.0216) and TNF (p = 0.0028, p = 0.0033) levels in CF serum and following PBMCs stimulation respectively. The corresponding mRNA levels were also found to be reduced in stimulated PBMCs, as well as reduced ASC specks and caspase-1 levels, indicative of NLRP3-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IL-18. While ETI therapy is highly effective at reducing sweat chloride and improving lung function, it also displays potent anti-inflammatory properties, which are likely to contribute to improved long-term clinical outcomes.",38820269,PMC11142445,10.1371/journal.pone.0304555,,2024,"Jarosz-Griffiths HH, Gillgrass L, Caley LR, Spoletini G, Clifton IJ, Etherington C, Savic S, McDermott MF, Peckham D.",Y,MED

Personalized CFTR Modulator Therapy for *G85E* and *N1303K* Homozygous Patients with Cystic Fibrosis.,"CFTR modulator therapy with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) has been approved for people with CF and at least one F508del allele in Europe. In the US, the ETI label has been expanded to 177 rare *CFTR* mutations responsive in Fischer rat thyroid cells, including *G85E*, but not *N1303K*. However, knowledge on the effect of ETI on G85E or N1303K CFTR function remains limited. In vitro effects of ETI were measured in primary human nasal epithelial cultures (pHNECs) of a *G85E* homozygous patient and an *N1303K* homozygous patient. Effects of ETI therapy in vivo in these patients were assessed using clinical outcomes, including multiple breath washout and lung MRI, and the CFTR biomarkers sweat chloride concentration (SCC), nasal potential difference (NPD) and intestinal current measurement (ICM), before and after initiation of ETI. ETI increased CFTR-mediated chloride transport in *G85E*/*G85E* and *N1303K*/*N1303K* pHNECs. In the *G85E*/*G85E* and the *N1303K*/*N1303K* patient, we observed an improvement in lung function, SCC, and CFTR function in the respiratory and rectal epithelium after initiation of ETI. The approach of combining preclinical in vitro testing with subsequent in vivo verification can facilitate access to CFTR modulator therapy and enhance precision medicine for patients carrying rare *CFTR* mutations.",37569738,PMC10418744,10.3390/ijms241512365,,2023,"Graeber SY, Balázs A, Ziegahn N, Rubil T, Vitzthum C, Piehler L, Drescher M, Seidel K, Rohrbach A, Röhmel J, Thee S, Duerr J, Mall MA, Stahl M.",Y,MED
"A Phase 3, Open-Label Study of Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor in Children 1 to Less Than 2 Years of Age with Cystic Fibrosis Homozygous for *F508del-CFTR*.","**Rationale:** Previous phase 3 trials showed that treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor was safe and efficacious in people aged ⩾2 years with cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygous for the *F508del* mutation in *CFTR* (CF transmembrane conductance regulator) (*F*/*F* genotype). **Objectives:** To assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in children aged 1 to <2 years with the *F*/*F* genotype. **Methods:** This open-label, phase 3 study consisted of two parts (part A [*n* = 14] and part B [*n* = 46]) in which two cohorts were enrolled on the basis of age (cohort 1, 18 to <24 mo; cohort 2, 12 to <18 mo). For the 15-day treatment period in part A, the lumacaftor/ivacaftor dose was based on weight at screening. Pharmacokinetic data from part A were used to determine dose-based weight boundaries for part B (24-wk treatment period). **Measurements and Main Results:** The primary endpoint of part A was pharmacokinetics, and the primary endpoint for part B was safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints for part B were absolute change in sweat chloride concentration from baseline at Week 24 and pharmacokinetics. Analysis of pharmacokinetic data from part A confirmed the appropriateness of part B dosing. In part B, 44 children (95.7%) had adverse events, which for most were either mild (52.2% of children) or moderate (39.1% of children) in severity. The most common adverse events were cough, infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF, pyrexia, and vomiting. At Week 24, mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride concentration was -29.1 mmol/L (95% confidence interval, -34.8 to -23.4 mmol/L). Growth parameters (body mass index, weight, length, and associated *z*-scores) were normal at baseline and remained normal during the 24-week treatment period. Improving trends in some biomarkers of pancreatic function and intestinal inflammation, such as fecal elastase-1, serum immunoreactive trypsinogen, and fecal calprotectin, were observed. **Conclusions:** Lumacaftor/ivacaftor was generally safe and well tolerated in children aged 1 to <2 years with the *F*/*F* genotype, with a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with studies in older children. Efficacy results, including robust reductions in sweat chloride concentration, suggest the potential for CF disease modification with lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment. These results support the use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in this population.

Newly Discovered Cutting-Edge Triple Combination Cystic Fibrosis Therapy: A Systematic Review.,"A cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductor regulator (CFTR) gene modulating triple therapy combining elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (Trikafta) has been recently discovered. Its approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019 has expanded the target therapy group to individuals aged twelve and up with at least one Phe508del (phenylalanine 508 deletion) mutation in the CFTR gene. This systematic review aims to assess this combination therapy's safety and efficacy. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, an in-depth search was performed. The search was done by utilizing databases such as PubMed Central (PMC), Google Scholar, and Science Direct for articles related to this topic. Studies published in the last five years in the English language were chosen preliminarily. Further eligibility criteria and quality assessment tools were employed to assess the risk of bias and finalize ten articles to be used in this review. The chosen articles constituted four randomized control trials (RCTs), four systematic reviews, and two narrative reviews. The last date for data collection was April 24, 2022. Based on the findings of this review, we concluded that by combining three CFTR modulators, this therapy had outperformed all the currently available medications in terms of improving pulmonary function, reducing exacerbations, and enhancing the quality of life of CF patients. In clinical trials, headache and rash were the most common side effects, and laboratory testing to assess liver function is suggested. Long-term safety and effectiveness must be confirmed by the continued review of real-life patient data. Studies done on triple therapy thus far have been promising. Unfortunately, a small proportion of the CF population remains ineligible for any form of CFTR modulator therapy owing to their type of genetic mutation, and this provides ground for further research in this field.",36284811,PMC9583755,10.7759/cureus.29359,,2022,"Dawood SN, Rabih AM, Niaj A, Raman A, Uprety M, Calero MJ, Villanueva MRB, Joshaghani N, Villa N, Badla O, Goit R, Saddik SE, Mohammed L.",Y,MED
Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor for cystic fibrosis with Phe508del mutation: Evidence from randomized controlled trials.,"Objective: This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effects of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ELX-TEZ-IVA) on patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to August 1, 2022. Meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.3 software.Results: Six studies comprising seven reports involving a total of 1125 CF patients were included. The meta-analyses indicated that ELX-TEZ-IVA significantly improved the percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV1) by 10.29% (95% confidence interval (CI) (6.44, 14.14), *p* < 0.00001) and the CF questionnaire-revised respiratory domain (CFQ-R RD) by 14.59 points (95% CI (9.25, 19.94), *p* < 0.00001) compared to placebo, ivacaftor (IVA), or tezacaftor-ivacaftor (TEZ-IVA). In addition, the ELX-TEZ-IVA group showed significantly lower sweat chloride concentrations by 40.30 mmol/L (95% CI (-49.85, -30.74), *p* < 0.00001). However, the incidence of adverse events in the ELX-TEZ-IVA group was slightly higher than that in the placebo, IVA, or TEZ-IVA groups.Conclusion: ELX-TEZ-IVA demonstrated efficacy in improving ppFEV1, CFQ-R RD, and sweat chloride concentrations in patients with CF. However, caution should be exercised regarding the incidence of AEs, particularly mild and moderate ones.",38249954,PMC10798108,10.1177/20503121231225874,,2024,"He R, Lin F, Deng Z, Yu B.",Y,MED
Identification of novel natural compounds against CFTR p.Gly628Arg pathogenic variant.,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein is an ion channel found in numerous epithelia and controls the flow of water and salt across the epithelium. The aim of our study to find natural compounds that can improve lung function for people with cystic fibrosis (CF) caused by the p.Gly628Arg (rs397508316) mutation of CFTR protein. The sequence of CFTR protein as a target structure was retrieved from UniProt and PDB database. The ligands that included Armepavine, Osthole, Curcumin, Plumbagine, Quercetin, and one Trikafta (R*) reference drug were screened out from PubChem database. Autodock vina software carried out docking, and binding energies between the drug and the target were included using docking-score. The following tools examined binding energy, interaction, stability, toxicity, and visualize protein-ligand complexes. The compounds having binding energies of -6.4, -5.1, -6.6, -5.1, and - 6.5 kcal/mol for Armepavine, Osthole, Curcumin, Plumbagine, Quercetin, and R*-drug, respectively with mutated CFTR (Gly628Arg) structure were chosen as the most promising ligands. The ligands bind to the mutated CFTR protein structure active sites in hydrophobic bonds, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interactions. According to ADMET analyses, the ligands Armepavine and Quercetin also displayed good pharmacokinetic and toxicity characteristics. An MD simulation for 200 ns was also established to ensure that Armepavine and Quercetin ligands attached to the target protein favorably and dynamically, and that protein-ligand complex stability was maintained. It is concluded that Armepavine and Quercetin have stronger capacity to inhibit the effect of mutated CFTR protein through improved trafficking and restoration of original function.",39249658,PMC11383896,10.1186/s13568-024-01762-9,,2024,"Khan MU, Sakhawat A, Rehman R, Wali AH, Ghani MU, Akram A, Javed MA, Ali Q, Yu-Ming Z, Ali D, Yu-Ming Z.",Y,MED
Synthesis and Evaluation of Ivacaftor Derivatives with Reduced Lipophilicity.,"Mutations in the unique ATP-binding cassette anion channel, the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR), lead to the inherited fatal disease known as cystic fibrosis (CF). Ivacaftor enhances channel gating of CFTR by stabilizing its open state and has been approved as monotherapy for CF patients with CFTR gating mutations (e.g., G551D) and as part of combination therapy with lumacaftor for CFTR folding mutations (e.g., ΔF508). However, in the latter context, ivacaftor may destabilize folding-rescued ΔF508-CFTR and membrane-associated proteins and attenuate lumacaftor pharmacotherapy. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the high lipophilicity of ivacaftor may contribute to this effect. We describe the synthesis of three glutamic acid ivacaftor derivatives with reduced lipophilicity that bear different charges at neutral pH (compounds **2**, **3**, **4**). In a cellular ion flux assay, all three restored G551D-CFTR channel activity at comparable or better levels than ivacaftor. Furthermore, unlike ivacaftor, compound **3** did not attenuate levels of folding-rescued ΔF508 at the cell surface. Molecular modeling predicts that the increased polarity of compound **3** allows engagement with polar amino acids present in the binding pocket with hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions, which are collectively higher in strength as compared to hydrophobic interactions that stabilize ivacaftor. Overall, the data suggests that reduced lipophilicity may improve the efficacy of this class of CFTR potentiators when used for folding-rescued ΔF508-CFTR.",38075767,PMC10702196,10.1021/acsomega.3c05839,,2023,"Iazzi M, Junor P, Doshi J, Acharya S, Sühring R, Viirre RD, Gupta GD.",Y,MED
APPLICATION OF QUANTILE DISCRETIZATION AND BAYESIAN NETWORK ANALYSIS TO PUBLICLY AVAILABLE CYSTIC FIBROSIS DATA SETS.,"The availability of multiple publicly-available datasets studying the same phenomenon has the promise of accelerating scientific discovery. Meta-analysis can address issues of reproducibility and often increase power. The promise of meta-analysis is especially germane to rarer diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF), which affects roughly 100,000 people worldwide. A recent search of the National Institute of Health's Gene Expression Omnibus revealed 1.3 million data sets related to cancer compared to about 2,000 related to CF. These studies are highly diverse, involving different tissues, animal models, treatments, and clinical covariates. In our search for gene expression studies of primary human airway epithelial cells, we identified three studies with compatible methodologies and sufficient metadata: GSE139078, Sala Study, and PRJEB9292. Even so, experimental designs were not identical, and we identified significant batch effects that would have complicated functional analysis. Here we present quantile discretization and Bayesian network construction using the Hill climb method as a powerful tool to overcome experimental differences and reveal biologically relevant responses to the CF genotype itself, exposure to virus, bacteria, and drugs used to treat CF. Functional patterns revealed by cluster Profiler included interferon signaling, interferon gamma signaling, interleukins 4 and 13 signaling, interleukin 6 signaling, interleukin 21 signaling, and inactivation of CSF3/G-CSF signaling pathways showing significant alterations. These pathways were consistently associated with higher gene expression in CF epithelial cells compared to non-CF cells, suggesting that targeting these pathways could improve clinical outcomes. The success of quantile discretization and Bayesian network analysis in the context of CF suggests that these approaches might be applicable to other contexts where exactly comparable data sets are hard to find.",38160305,PMC10783867,,,2024,"Fukutani KF, Hampton TH, Bobak CA, MacKenzie TA, Stanton BA.",Y,MED
L1077P CFTR pathogenic variant function rescue by Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor in cystic fibrosis patient-derived air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures and organoids: in vitro guided personalized therapy of non-F508del patients.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by defects of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CFTR-modulating drugs may overcome specific defects, such as the case of Trikafta, which is a clinically approved triple combination of Elexacaftor, Tezacaftor and Ivacaftor (ETI) that exhibited a strong ability to rescue the function of the most frequent F508del pathogenic variant even in genotypes with the mutated allele in single copy. Nevertheless, most rare genotypes lacking the F508del allele are still not eligible for targeted therapies. Via the innovative approach of using nasal conditionally reprogrammed cell (CRC) cell-based models that mimic patient disease in vitro, which are obtainable from each patient due to the 100% efficiency of the cell culture establishment, we theratyped orphan CFTR mutation L1077P. Protein studies, Forskolin-induced organoid swelling, and Ussing chamber assays congruently proved the L1077P variant function rescue by ETI. Notably, this rescue takes place even in the context of a single-copy L1077P allele, which appears to enhance its expression. Thus, the possibility of single-allele treatment also arises for rare genotypes, with an allele-specific modulation as part of the mechanism. Of note, besides providing indication of drug efficacy with respect to specific CFTR pathogenic variants or genotypes, this approach allows the evaluation of the response of single-patient cells within their genetic background. In this view, our studies support in vitro guided personalized CF therapies also for rare patients who are nearly excluded from clinical trials.",37674160,PMC10483775,10.1186/s12931-023-02516-0,,2023,"Lo Cicero S, Castelli G, Blaconà G, Bruno SM, Sette G, Pigliucci R, Villella VR, Esposito S, Zollo I, Spadaro F, Maria R, Biffoni M, Cimino G, Amato F, Lucarelli M, Eramo A.",Y,MED
Diabetes outbreak during COVID19 lock-down in a prediabetic patient with cystic fibrosis long treated with glargine.,"Background: Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD) is a frequent comorbidity of patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). A worsening of clinical conditions appears before CFRD. It has been demonstrated a decline in pulmonary function and nutritional status also in patients with prediabetes. Few trials show that insulin may be beneficial in prediabetic CF patients, to date guidelines do not recommend for this condition.Case presentation: We report a case of a patient treated with insulin glargine at 13 years, due to glycemic intolerance, and with Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor at 15 years. A reduction of pulmonary exacerbations was observed after glargine therapy, also confirmed after the starting of Lumacaftor/ Ivacaftor in this patient. Pulmonary function improved only after the first year of glargine therapy, then a deterioration appeared due to the natural history of CF lung damage. During the COVID-19 lockdown, poor adherence to care contributed to diabetes mellitus onset needing high insulin requirements. After two weeks the patient returned to prediabetic condition and his previous dose of glargine.Conclusions: our case highlights firstly that insulin glargine has contributed to preserve him from further clinical worsening due to prediabetes in the years before pandemic, secondly the negative impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the clinical course of a chronic disease as CF.",34078438,PMC8170445,10.1186/s13052-021-01076-7,,2021,"Rosanio FM, Mozzillo E, Cimbalo C, Casertano A, Sepe A, Raia V, Franzese A, Tosco A.",Y,MED
Psychometric performance of the CFQ-R-8D compared to the EQ-5D-3L and SF-6D in people with cystic fibrosis.,"Objective: This study aimed to compare the psychometric performance of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised-8 Dimensions (CFQ-R-8D), a new, condition-specific, preference-based measure, with that of generic preference-based measures EQ-5D-3L and Short Form 6 dimensions (SF-6D).Methods: Data from three trials of participants with CF aged ≥ 14 years who completed the CFQ-R and EQ-5D-3L or SF-6D were used. Analyses were undertaken to evaluate convergent validity based on correlations with CFQ-R domain scores. Known-group validity was assessed based on percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second and pulmonary exacerbations. Responsiveness was based on correlation of change and sensitivity to change based on change in symptom severity. Effect sizes and standardized response means were estimated.Results: CFQ-R-8D utilities and dimensions were strongly correlated with most of the overlapping CFQ-R domain scores (ρ > 0.5); EQ-5D-3L and SF-6D utilities and dimensions had moderate (ρ > 0.3) to strong correlations in dimensions capturing similar concepts. All measures showed evidence of known-group validity (P < 0.05). Change correlations were strong for CFQ-R-8D utilities and dimensions and CFQ-R, but they were moderate for SF-6D and mostly weak ((ρ > 0.1) for EQ-5D-3L. The SF-6D had the largest mean change over time and effect sizes, followed by CFQ-R-8D and then EQ-5D-3L. Neither CFQ-R-8D or SF-6D utility scores had ceiling effects (< 9% responses in full health) compared with those of EQ-5D-3L (61-62%). In participants classified as being in full health by EQ-5D-3L, CFQ-R-8D captured CF-specific health problems, particularly cough, abdominal pain, and breathing difficulty.Conclusions: The CFQ-R-8D reflected known-group differences and changes over time with stronger evidence of good psychometric performance than EQ-5D-3L and similar evidence as SF-6D. Additionally, the CFQ-R-8D captured more condition-specific symptoms than EQ-5D-3L or SF-6D, which are important determinants of health-related quality of life for people with CF.",38416239,PMC10900011,10.1186/s41687-024-00697-w,,2024,"Mukuria C, Rowen D, Acaster S, McGarry LJ, Lou Y, Sosnay PR, Quittner AL.",Y,MED
Pharmacological Improvement of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Function Rescues Airway Epithelial Homeostasis and Host Defense in Children with Cystic Fibrosis.,"**Rationale:** Pharmacological improvement of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) provides unprecedented improvements in lung function and other clinical outcomes in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, ETI effects on impaired mucosal homeostasis and host defense at the molecular and cellular levels in the airways of patients with CF remain unknown. **Objectives:** To investigate effects of ETI on the transcriptome of nasal epithelial and immune cells from children with CF at the single-cell level. **Methods:** Nasal swabs from 13 children with CF and at least one *F508del* allele aged 6 to 11 years were collected at baseline and 3 months after initiation of ETI, subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing, and compared with swabs from 12 age-matched healthy children. **Measurements and Main Results:** Proportions of *CFTR*-positive cells were decreased in epithelial basal, club, and goblet cells, but not in ionocytes, from children with CF at baseline and were restored by ETI therapy to nearly healthy levels. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed an impaired IFN signaling and reduced expression of major histocompatibility complex classes I and II encoding genes in epithelial cells of children with CF at baseline, which was partially restored by ETI. In addition, ETI therapy markedly reduced the inflammatory phenotype of immune cells, particularly of neutrophils and macrophages. **Conclusions:** Pharmacological improvement of CFTR function improves innate mucosal immunity and reduces immune cell inflammatory responses in the upper airways of children with CF at the single-cell level, highlighting the potential to restore epithelial homeostasis and host defense in CF airways by early initiation of ETI therapy.",38259174,PMC11146576,10.1164/rccm.202310-1836oc,,2024,"Loske J, Völler M, Lukassen S, Stahl M, Thürmann L, Seegebarth A, Röhmel J, Wisniewski S, Messingschlager M, Lorenz S, Klages S, Eils R, Lehmann I, Mall MA, Graeber SY, Trump S.",Y,MED
Current landscape of cystic fibrosis gene therapy.,"Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening disease that is caused by mutations in *CFTR*, a gene which encodes an ion channel that supports proper function of several epithelial tissues, most critically the lung. Without CFTR, airway barrier mechanisms are impaired, allowing for chronic, recurrent infections that result in airway remodeling and deterioration of lung structure and function. Small molecule modulators can rescue existing, defective CFTR protein; however, they still leave a subset of people with CF with no current disease modifying treatments, aside from lung transplantation. Gene therapy directed to the lung is a promising strategy to modify CF disease in the organ most associated with morbidity and mortality. It is accomplished through delivery of a CFTR transgene with an airway permissive vector. Despite more than three decades of research in this area, a lung directed gene therapy has yet to be realized. There is hope that with improved delivery vectors, sufficient transduction of airway cells can achieve therapeutic levels of functional CFTR. In order to do this, preclinical programs need to meet a certain level of CFTR protein expression *in vitro* and *in vivo* through improved transduction, particularly in relevant airway cell types. Furthermore, clinical programs must be designed with sensitive methods to detect CFTR expression and function as well as methods to measure meaningful endpoints for lung structure, function and disease. Here, we discuss the current understanding of how much and where *CFTR* needs to be expressed, the most advanced vectors for *CFTR* delivery and clinical considerations for detecting CFTR protein and function in different patient subsets.",39439894,PMC11493704,10.3389/fphar.2024.1476331,,2024,"Plasschaert LW, MacDonald KD, Moffit JS.",Y,MED
"Discovery of GLPG2737, a Potent Type 2 Corrector of CFTR for the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Combination with a Potentiator and a Type 1 Co-corrector.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. This epithelial anion channel regulates the active transport of chloride and bicarbonate ions across membranes. Mutations result in reduced surface expression of CFTR channels with impaired functionality. Correctors are small molecules that support the trafficking of CFTR to increase its membrane expression. Such correctors can have different mechanisms of action. Combinations may result in a further improved therapeutic benefit. We describe the identification and optimization of a new pyrazolol3,4-bl pyridine-6-carboxylic acid series with high potency and efficacy in rescuing CFTR from the cell surface. Investigations showed that carboxylic acid group replacement with acylsulfonamides and acylsulfonylureas improved ADMET and PK properties, leading to the discovery of the structurally novel co-corrector GLPG2737. The addition of GLPG2737 to the combination of the potentiator GLPG1837 and C1 corrector **4** led to an 8-fold increase in the F508del CFTR activity.",38527911,PMC11017246,10.1021/acs.jmedchem.3c01790,,2024,"Pizzonero M, Akkari R, Bock X, Gosmini R, De Lemos E, Duthion B, Newsome G, Mai TT, Roques V, Jary H, Lefrancois JM, Cherel L, Quenehen V, Babel M, Merayo N, Bienvenu N, Mammoliti O, Coti G, Palisse A, Cowart M, Shrestha A, Greszler S, Van Der Plas S, Jansen K, Claes P, Jans M, Gees M, Borgonovi M, De Wilde G, Conrath K.",Y,MED

Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing Provides Prognostic Information in Advanced Cystic Fibrosis Lung Disease.,"**Rationale:** Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) provides prognostic information in cystic fibrosis (CF); however, its prognostic value for patients with advanced CF lung disease is unknown. **Objectives:** To determine the prognostic value of CPET on the risk of death or lung transplant (LTX) within 2 years. **Methods:** We retrospectively collected data from 20 CF centers in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America on patients with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ⩽ 40% predicted who performed a cycle ergometer CPET between January 2008 and December 2017. Time to death/LTX was analyzed using mixed Cox proportional hazards regression. Conditional inference trees were modeled to identify subgroups with increased risk of death/LTX. **Results:** In total, 174 patients (FEV1, 30.9% ± 5.8% predicted) were included. Forty-four patients (25.5%) died or underwent LTX. Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and FEV1 revealed percentage predicted peak oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]o2peak) and peak work rate (Wpeak) as significant predictors of death/LTX: adjusted hazard ratios per each additional 10% predicted were 0.60 (95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.90; *P* = 0.008) and 0.60 (0.48-0.82; *P* < 0.001). Tree-structured regression models, including a set of 11 prognostic factors for survival, identified Wpeak to be most strongly associated with 2-year risk of death/LTX. Probability of death/LTX was 45.2% for those with a Wpeak ⩽ 49.2% predicted versus 10.9% for those with a Wpeak > 49.2% predicted (*P* < 0.001). **Conclusions:** CPET provides prognostic information in advanced CF lung disease, and Wpeak appears to be a promising marker for LTX referral and candidate selection.",37879036,PMC10913772,10.1513/annalsats.202304-317oc,,2024,"Radtke T, Urquhart DS, Braun J, Barry PJ, Waller I, Petch N, Mei-Zahav M, Kramer MR, Hua-Huy T, Dinh-Xuan AT, Innes JA, McArthur S, Sovtic A, Gojsina B, Verges S, de Maat T, Morrison L, Wood J, Crute S, Williams CA, Tomlinson OW, Bar-Yoseph R, Hebestreit A, Quon BS, Kwong E, Saynor ZL, Causer AJ, Stephenson AL, Schneiderman JE, Shaw M, Dwyer T, Stevens D, Remus N, Douvry B, Foster K, Benden C, Ratjen F, Hebestreit H, Prognostic Value of CPET in CF Study Group.",Y,MED
Real-life impact of highly effective CFTR modulator therapy in children with cystic fibrosis.,"**Introduction:** Recently, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator modulator therapy with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor has become available for children with cystic fibrosis (CF) carrying at least one *F508del* mutation. **Objective:** To assess the intermediate term effects of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in children with cystic fibrosis in a real-world setting. **Methods:** We performed a retrospective analysis of records of children with cystic fibrosis, who started elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor between 8/2020 and 10/2022. Pulmonary function tests, nutritional status, sweat chloride and laboratory data were assessed before, 3 and 6 months after the start of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor respectively. **Results:** Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor was started in 22 children 6-11 years and in 24 children 12-17 years. Twenty-seven (59%) patients were homozygous for *F508del* (F/F) and 23 (50%) patients were transitioned from ivacaftor/lumacaftor (IVA/LUM) or tezacaftor/ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA) to elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor. Overall, mean sweat chloride concentration decreased by 59.3 mmol/L (95% confidence interval: -65.0 to -53.7 mmol/L, *p* < 0.0001) under elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor. Sweat chloride concentration also decreased significantly after transition from IVA/LUM or TEZ/IVA to elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (-47.8 mmol/l; 95% confidence interval: -57.6 to -37.8 mmol/l, *n* = 14, *p* < 0.0001). Sweat chloride reduction was more marked in children with the F/F than in those with the F/MF genotype (69.4 vs 45.9 mmol/L, *p* < 0.0001). At 3 months follow-up, body-mass-index-z-score increased by 0.31 (95% CI, 0.2-0.42, *p* < 0.0001) with no further increase at 6 months. BMI-for-age-z-score was more markedly improved in the older group. Overall pulmonary function (percent predicted FEV1) at 3 months follow-up increased by 11.4% (95% CI: 8.0-14.9, *p* < 0.0001) with no further significant change after 6 months. No significant differences were noted between the age groups. Children with the F/MF genotype had a greater benefit regarding nutritional status and pulmonary function tests than those with the F/F genotype. Adverse events led to elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor dose reduction in three cases and a temporary interruption of therapy in four cases. **Conclusion:** In a real-world setting, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor therapy had beneficial clinical effects and a good safety profile in eligible children with cystic fibrosis comparable to previously published data from controlled clinical trials. The positive impact on pulmonary function tests and nutritional status seen after 3 months of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor therapy was sustained at 6 months follow-up.",37229253,PMC10203630,10.3389/fphar.2023.1176815,,2023,"Olivier M, Kavvalou A, Welsner M, Hirtz R, Straßburg S, Sutharsan S, Stehling F, Steindor M.",Y,MED

This study aims to delineate the genotypic and phenotypic landscape of CF among people with CF (pwCF) followed at the largest CF center in Turkey.Methods: We conducted a descriptive and retrospective analysis of 481 patients registered with the European CF Society Patient Registry and followed at Marmara University Selim Çöremen CF Center from 2015 onwards. Comprehensive CFTR analysis was utilized for genetic diagnosis. Besides the whole cohort, novel variants and complex alleles were also described.Results: Our cohort exhibited a broad spectrum of CFTR variants, with 136 different variants detected, indicating substantial genetic diversity. The F508del variant was less prevalent in our cohort compared to US and European averages, which could reflect unique genetic and demographic characteristics of the Turkish population. Additionally, we identified nine novel variants in 12 alleles, which enhances the understanding of CF's genetic complexity in this region, and complex alleles in 32 pwCF.Conclusion: Our research underscores the heterogeneity of CFTR variants in Turkey and highlights the necessity for extensive genetic profiling particularly for diverse populations to provide effective personalized treatment strategies. It is crucial to understand the full spectrum of CFTR variants with the advent of CFTR modulators.",39291770,PMC11600995,10.1002/ppul.27249,,2024,"Yıldız CA, Selçuk Balcı M, Karabulut Ş, Başer ZM, Kalyoncu M, Metin Çakar N, Akkitap Yiğit MM, Baysal EE, Özdemircioğlu F, Uzunoğlu B, Taştan G, Ergenekon P, Gökdemir Y, Erdem Eralp E, Karakoç F, Ata P, Karadağ B.",Y,MED
Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor improves exercise capacity in adolescents with cystic fibrosis.,"Objective: Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor is a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator with the potential to improve exercise capacity. This case series of three adolescents with CF aimed to investigate whether 6 weeks treatment with Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor could improve exercise capacity in CFTR modulator naive adolescents with CF.Methods: Three adolescents (14.0 ± 1.4 years) with CF (FEV1 % predicted: 62.5 ± 17.1; F508del/F508del genotype) completed an exhaustive maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test on a cycle ergometer to determine peak oxygen uptake ( V ̇ $\dot{{\rm{V}}}$ O2peak ) and measure changes in gas exchange and ventilation during exercise at 6 weeks. We also analyzed wrist-worn device-based physical activity (PA) data in two of the three cases. Validated acceleration thresholds were used to quantify time spent in each PA intensity category.Results: Clinically meaningful improvements in V ̇ $\dot{{\rm{V}}}$ O2peak were observed in all three cases (+17.6%, +52.4%, and +32.9%, respectively), with improvements greatest in those with more severe lung disease and lower fitness at baseline. Although lung function increased in all cases, inconsistent changes in markers of ventilatory and peripheral muscle efficiency likely suggest different mechanisms of improvement in this case group of adolescents with CF. Device-based analysis of PA was variable, with one case increasing and one case decreasing.Conclusion: In this case series, we have observed, for the first time, improvements in exercise capacity following 6 weeks of treatment with Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor. Improvements were greatest in the presence of more severe CF lung disease and lower aerobic fitness at baseline. The mechanism(s) responsible for these changes warrant further investigation in larger trials.",35851858,PMC9795914,10.1002/ppul.26078,,2022,"Causer AJ, Shute JK, Cummings MH, Shepherd AI, Wallbanks SR, Pulsford RM, Bright V, Connett G, Saynor ZL.",Y,MED
Effects of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor on Cardiorespiratory Polygraphy Parameters and Respiratory Muscle Strength in Cystic Fibrosis Patients with Severe Lung Disease.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators represent targeted therapies directly acting on the CFTR channel. The triple therapy Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) has been demonstrated to improve lung function and quality of life in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. However, the effects of ELX/TEZ/IVA on sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and respiratory muscle strength are poorly studied. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of ELX/TEZ/IVA in patients with CF and severe lung disease on cardiorespiratory polygraphy parameters, maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) measures.Methods: patients with CF aged ≥ 12 who started treatment in a compassionate use program were retrospectively studied through the evaluation of nocturnal cardiorespiratory polygraphy parameters, MIP and MEP; and six-minute walk test (6MWT) at baseline and at months 3, 6, and 12 of treatment.Results: Nine patients (mean age 30.3 ± 6.5 years) with severe CF (mean baseline ppFEV1 34.6 ± 5.1%) were evaluated. A significant improvement in nocturnal oxygenation measured by mean SpO2 (92.4 vs. 96.4%, *p* < 0.05), time spent with SpO2 ≤ 90% (-12.6, -14.6, -15.2 min from baseline at months 3, 6, and 12, respectively, *p* < 0.05), and respiratory rate (RR) was shown, at month 12 and across the time points compared with baseline, as well as in respiratory muscle strength, although only the change in MEP was significant.Conclusions: We provide further evidence on the efficacy of the CFTR modulators ELX/TEZ/IVA, adding information about their effect on the respiratory muscles' performance and cardiorespiratory polygraphy parameters in CF patients with severe lung disease.",36833376,PMC9956139,10.3390/genes14020449,,2023,"Giallongo A, Parisi GF, Papale M, Manti S, Mulé E, Aloisio D, Terlizzi V, Rotolo N, Leonardi S.",Y,MED
Cystic fibrosis patient characteristics and healthcare resource utilization in Finland using linked registries.,"Background: Knowledge of prevalence and epidemiology of cystic fibrosis (CF) and healthcare resource use among Finnish people with CF is incomplete.Methods: We conducted a population-based matched cohort study using retrospective real-world data from linked Finnish national registries. Electronic healthcare data and drug purchases of 102 people with CF were analyzed between January 2015 and December 2019 (follow-up). A 5-fold control population was matched by sex, age, and place of residence. Comorbidities and medication use that occurred at any time during follow-up were assessed; annual rates of hospital service use were adjusted for follow-up.Results: The prevalence of CF in Finland was 1.85 per 100,000. Median age at diagnosis was 1 year, with 60 % diagnosed at age <2 years and 80 % at age <10 years. Median age at death in people with CF was 31.4 years (n < 5); no controls died. The most common comorbidities included chronic sinusitis (39.2 %), pneumonia (38.2 %), diabetes (20.6 %), and nasal polyps (18.6 %). The most purchased medications were antibiotics (99.0 %) and pancreatic enzymes (84.3 %). The annualized rate of hospital visits was higher in people with CF vs controls (outpatient: mean [SD], 17.4 [14.5] vs 0.9 [3.3]; median, 13.6 vs 0.4, respectively; inpatient: mean [SD], 1.0 [1.66] vs 0.03 [0.14]; median, 0.34 vs 0, respectively).Conclusions: The prevalence of CF in Finland is remarkably low, likely reflecting unique population characteristics and, in part, delayed diagnosis. Antibiotic use is frequent among Finnish people with CF. Inpatient hospital visits are >30 times higher in people with CF than matched controls.",39040318,PMC11261030,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e33439,,2024,"Malmivaara K, Pölkki M, Prami T, Raittinen P, Heikkilä E, Aalto A, Dunder T, Elenius V, Sandström K, McGarry LJ.",Y,MED

A Gastroenterologist's Guide to Care Transitions in Cystic Fibrosis from Pediatrics to Adult Care.,"Cystic Fibrosis is a chronic disease affecting multiple systems, including the GI tract. Clinical manifestation in patients can start as early as infancy and vary across different age groups. With the advent of new, highly effective modulators, the life expectancy of PwCF has improved significantly. Various GI aspects of CF care, such as nutrition, are linked to an overall improvement in morbidity, lung function and the quality of life of PwCF. The variable clinical presentations and management of GI diseases in pediatrics and adults with CF should be recognized. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure efficient transfer of information between pediatric and adult providers for proper continuity of management and coordination of care at the time of transition. The transition of care is a challenging process for both patients and providers and currently there are no specific tools for GI providers to help ensure a smooth transition. In this review, we aim to highlight the crucial features of GI care at the time of transition and provide a checklist that can assist in ensuring an effective transition and ease the challenges associated with it.",37958749,PMC10648514,10.3390/ijms242115766,,2023,"Patel D, Baliss M, Saikumar P, Numan L, Teckman J, Hachem C.",Y,MED
CFTR dysfunction in smooth muscle drives TGFβ dependent airway hyperreactivity.,"Background: The primary underlying defect in cystic fibrosis (CF) is disrupted ion transport in epithelia throughout the body. It is unclear if symptoms such as airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) volume in people with CF are due to inherent abnormalities in smooth muscle or are secondary to epithelial dysfunction. Transforming Growth Factor beta 1 (TGFβ) is an established genetic modifier of CF lung disease and a known driver of abnormal ASM function. Prior studies have demonstrated that CF mice develop greater AHR, goblet cell hyperplasia, and ASM hypertrophy after pulmonary TGFβ exposure. However, the mechanism driving these abnormalities in CF lung disease, specifically the contribution of CFTR loss in ASM, was unknown.Methods: In this study, mice with smooth muscle-specific loss of CFTR function (Cftrfl/fl; SM-Cre mice) were exposed to pulmonary TGFβ. The impact on lung pathology and physiology was investigated through examination of lung mechanics, Western blot analysis, and pulmonary histology.Results: Cftrfl/fl; SM-Cre mice treated with TGFβ demonstrated greater methacholine-induced AHR than control mice. However, Cftrfl/fl; SM-Cre mice did not develop increased inflammation, ASM area, or goblet cell hyperplasia relative to controls following TGFβ exposure.Conclusions: These results demonstrate a direct smooth muscle contribution to CF airway obstruction mediated by TGFβ. Dysfunction in non-epithelial tissues should be considered in the development of CF therapeutics, including potential genetic therapies.",37568151,PMC10416378,10.1186/s12931-023-02495-2,,2023,"Kramer EL, Hudock KM, Davidson CR, Clancy JP.",Y,MED

The Challenging Life of Mutators: How *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* Survives between Persistence and Evolution in Cystic Fibrosis Lung.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening genetic disease characterised by chronic lung infections sustained by opportunistic pathogens such as *Pseudomonas aeruginosa.* During the chronic long-lasting lung infections, *P. aeruginosa* adapts to the host environment. Hypermutability, mainly due to defects in the DNA repair system, resulting in an increased spontaneous mutation rate, represents a way to boost the rapid adaptation frequently encountered in CF *P. aeruginosa* isolates. We selected 609 isolates from 51 patients with CF chronically colonised by *P. aeruginosa* to study, by full-length genome sequencing, the longitudinal evolution of the bacterium. We recovered at least one hypermutable (mutator) isolate in 57% of patients. By combining genomic information and phenotypic analyses, we followed the evolutionary pathways of the *P. aeruginosa* mutator strains, identifying their contribution to multi-drug resistance and the emergence of new sub-lineages. By implementing patient clinical data, we observed that mutators preferentially follow a specific evolutionary trajectory in patients with a negative clinical outcome and that maintenance antibiotic polytherapy, based on alternating molecules, apparently reduces the occurrence of hypermutability. Finally, we draw attention to the possibility that modulator-induced changes in the pulmonary environment may be associated with the onset of hypermutability.",39458360,PMC11509988,10.3390/microorganisms12102051,,2024,"Rossitto M, Fox V, Vrenna G, Tuccio Guarna Assanti V, Essa N, Lepanto MS, Raimondi S, Agosta M, Cortazzo V, Fini V, Granaglia A, Montemitro E, Cutrera R, Perno CF, Bernaschi P.",Y,MED
Impact of CFTR modulators on exercise capacity in adolescents with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Exercise capacity is an independent predictor of clinical worsening in cystic fibrosis (CF). There is limited evidence of the impact of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators on exercise capacity in children with CF. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of CFTR modulators on exercise capacity in a cohort of adolescents with CF.Methods: A prospective single-centre cohort study was carried out. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was performed at baseline, prior to starting Symkevi or Kaftrio and between 4 and 8 months after starting treatment.Results: 19 adolescents with CF had CPET performed prior to and after CFTR modulator treatment, between December 2019 and March 2022. Breathing reserve improved in the whole cohort, with greater improvement in the modulator-naïve patients after starting treatment with Kaftrio. There was no improvement in peak oxygen uptake and anaerobic threshold after 4 to 8 months of treatment with CFTR modulators.Conclusion: Exercise testing with CPET can be used as an additional tool to monitor response to CFTR modulators. Breathing reserve on CPET may provide a surrogate marker to monitor the improvement in CF lung disease with CFTR modulator treatment.",38375430,PMC10875456,10.1183/23120541.00687-2023,,2024,"Ahmed MI, Dayman N, Blyth N, Madge J, Gaillard E.",Y,MED
Virtual Drug Repositioning as a Tool to Identify Natural Small Molecules That Synergize with Lumacaftor in F508del-CFTR Binding and Rescuing.,"Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease mainly caused by the deletion of the Phe 508 (F508del) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein that is thus withheld in the endoplasmic reticulum and rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin/proteasome system. Cystic fibrosis remains a potentially fatal disease, but it has become treatable as a chronic condition due to some CFTR-rescuing drugs that, when used in combination, increase in their therapeutic effect due to a synergic action. Also, dietary supplementation of natural compounds in combination with approved drugs could represent a promising strategy to further alleviate cystic fibrosis symptoms. On these bases, we screened by in silico drug repositioning 846 small synthetic or natural compounds from the AIFA database to evaluate their capacity to interact with the highly druggable lumacaftor binding site of F508del-CFTR. Among the identified hits, nicotinamide (NAM) was predicted to accommodate into the lumacaftor binding region of F508del-CFTR without competing against the drug but rather stabilizing its binding. The effective capacity of NAM to bind F508del-CFTR in a lumacaftor-uncompetitive manner was then validated experimentally by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Finally, the capacity of NAM to synergize with lumacaftor increasing its CFTR-rescuing activity was demonstrated in cell-based assays. This study suggests the possible identification of natural small molecules devoid of side effects and endowed with the capacity to synergize with drugs currently employed for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, which hopefully will increase the therapeutic efficacy with lower doses.",36293130,PMC9602983,10.3390/ijms232012274,,2022,"Fossa P, Uggeri M, Orro A, Urbinati C, Rondina A, Milanesi M, Pedemonte N, Pesce E, Padoan R, Ford RC, Meng X, Rusnati M, D'Ursi P.",Y,MED

ELX/TEZ/IVA improves lung function and decreases the frequency of CF exacerbations in clinical studies, which has led to investigation of this therapy on rare CFTR variants. Rare mutations have limited research publications; therefore, reporting outcomes is critical to expanding knowledge and understanding of therapeutic efficacy. This case highlights a CF adolescent homozygous for the G85E CFTR variant who had resolution of chronic respiratory symptoms after initiating ELX/TEZ/IVA.",36411821,PMC9674891,10.1016/j.rmcr.2022.101775,,2022,"Stekolchik E, Saul D, Chidekel A.",Y,MED
CFTR Modulators in People with Cystic Fibrosis: Real-World Evidence in France.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare genetic multisystemic disease, the manifestations of which are due to mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein and can lead to respiratory insufficiency and premature death. CFTR modulators, which were developed in the past decade, partially restore CFTR protein function. Their clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in phase 3 clinical trials, particularly in terms of lung function and pulmonary exacerbations, nutritional status, and quality of life in people with gating mutations (ivacaftor), homozygous for the F508del mutation (lumacaftor/ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor), and in those with at least one F508del mutation (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor). However, many questions remain regarding their long-term safety and effectiveness, particularly in patients with advanced lung disease, liver disease, renal insufficiency, or problematic bacterial colonization. The impact of CFTR modulators on other important outcomes such as concurrent treatments, lung transplantation, chest imaging, or pregnancies also warrants further investigation. The French CF Reference Network includes 47 CF centers that contribute patient data to the comprehensive French CF Registry and have conducted nationwide real-world studies on CFTR modulators. This review seeks to summarize the results of these real-world studies and examine their findings against those of randomized control trials.",35681464,PMC9179538,10.3390/cells11111769,,2022,"Regard L, Martin C, Burnet E, Da Silva J, Burgel PR.",Y,MED
Laboratory Tools to Predict CFTR Modulator Therapy Effectiveness and to Monitor Disease Severity in Cystic Fibrosis.,"The implementation of cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator drugs into clinical practice has been attaining remarkable therapeutic outcomes for CF, a life-threatening autosomal recessive genetic disease. However, there is elevated CFTR allelic heterogeneity, and various individuals carrying (ultra)rare CF genotypes remain without any approved modulator therapy. Novel translational model systems based on individuals' own cells/tissue are now available and can be used to interrogate in vitro CFTR modulator responses and establish correlations of these assessments with clinical features, aiming to provide prediction of therapeutic effectiveness. Furthermore, because CF is a progressive disease, assessment of biomarkers in routine care is fundamental in monitoring treatment effectiveness and disease severity. In the first part of this review, we aimed to focus on the utility of individual-derived in vitro models (such as bronchial/nasal epithelial cells and airway/intestinal organoids) to identify potential responders and expand personalized CF care. Thereafter, we discussed the usage of CF inflammatory biomarkers derived from blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and sputum to routinely monitor treatment effectiveness and disease progression. Finally, we summarized the progress in investigating extracellular vesicles as a robust and reliable source of biomarkers and the identification of microRNAs related to CFTR regulation and CF inflammation as novel biomarkers, which may provide valuable information for disease prognosis.",38248793,PMC10820563,10.3390/jpm14010093,,2024,"Bacalhau M, Camargo M, Lopes-Pacheco M.",Y,MED
"Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes Workshop: Research Priorities Spanning Disease Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Outcomes.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive disorder arising from mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. CFTR is expressed in numerous tissues, with high expression in the airways, small and large intestine, pancreatic and hepatobiliary ducts, and male reproductive tract. CFTR loss in these tissues disrupts regulation of salt, bicarbonate, and water balance across their epithelia, resulting in a systemic disorder with progressive organ dysfunction and damage. Pancreatic exocrine damage ultimately manifests as pancreatic exocrine insufficiency that begins as early as infancy. Pancreatic remodeling accompanies this early damage, during which abnormal glucose tolerance can be observed in toddlers. With increasing age, however, insulin secretion defects progress such that CF-related diabetes (CFRD) occurs in 20% of teens and up to half of adults with CF. The relevance of CFRD is highlighted by its association with increased morbidity, mortality, and patient burden. While clinical research on CFRD has greatly assisted in the care of individuals with CFRD, key knowledge gaps on CFRD pathogenesis remain. Furthermore, the wide use of CFTR modulators to restore CFTR activity is changing the CFRD clinical landscape and the field's understanding of CFRD pathogenesis.

We performed a modified 2-h OGTT protocol (1.75 g/kg, maximum 75 g), sampling at baseline and at 30-min intervals, analyzing plasma glucose, serum insulin, and C-peptide. The modified OGTT allowed for the modeling of β cell function. For all variables, multivariable quantile regression was performed to estimate the median, the 25th, and 75th percentiles, with age, sex, and pancreatic insufficiency as predictors.Results: We have quantified the deterioration of glucose tolerance and insulin secretion with age according to sex and pancreatic insufficiency, highlighting a deviation from linearity both for patients <10 years and >35 years of age.Conclusions: References of OGTT variables for PwCF provide a necessary tool to not only identify patients at risk for CFRD or other cystic fibrosis-related complications, but also to evaluate the effects of promising pharmacological therapies.",36983651,PMC10056682,10.3390/jpm13030469,,2023,"Foppiani A, Ciciriello F, Bisogno A, Bricchi S, Colombo C, Alghisi F, Lucidi V, Catena MA, Lucanto M, Mari A, Bedogni G, Battezzati A.",Y,MED
Long-Term Outcomes in Real Life of Lumacaftor-Ivacaftor Treatment in Adolescents With Cystic Fibrosis.,"**Background:** The combination of the CFTR corrector lumacaftor (LUM) and potentiator ivacaftor (IVA) has been labeled in France since 2015 for F508del homozygote cystic fibrosis (CF) patients over 12 years. In this real-life study, we aimed (i) to compare the changes in lung function, clinical (e.g., body mass index and pulmonary exacerbations) and radiological parameters, and in sweat chloride concentration before and after initiation of LUM/IVA treatment; (ii) to identify factors associated with response to treatment; and (iii) to assess the tolerance to treatment. **Materials and Methods:** In this tri-center, non-interventional, and observational cohort study, children (12-18 years old) were assessed prospectively during the 2 years of therapy, and retrospectively during the 2 years preceding treatment. Data collected and analyzed for the study were exclusively extracted from the medical electronic system records of the patients. **Results:** Forty adolescents aged 12.0-17.4 years at LUM/IVA initiation were included. The lung function decreased significantly during and prior to treatment and increased after LUM/IVA initiation, becoming significant after 2 years of treatment. LUM/IVA significantly improved the BMI *Z*-score and sweat chloride concentration. By contrast, there was no significant change in exacerbation rates, antibiotic use, or CT scan scores. Age at LUM/IVA initiation was lower in good responders and associated with greater ppFEV1 change during the 2 years of treatment. LUM/IVA was well-tolerated. **Conclusion:** In F508del homozygote adolescents, real-life long-term LUM/IVA improved the ppFEV1 trajectory, particularly in the youngest patients, nutritional status, and sweat chloride concentration but not exacerbation rates or radiological scores.

Nutritional Care in Children with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are prone to malnutrition and growth failure, mostly due to malabsorption caused by the derangement in the chloride transport across epithelial surfaces. Thus, optimal nutritional care and support should be an integral part of the management of the disease, with the aim of ameliorating clinical outcomes and life expectancy. In this report, we analyzed the nutrition support across the different ages, in patients with CF, with a focus on the relationships with growth, nutritional status, disease outcomes and the use of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators. The nutrition support goal in CF care should begin as early as possible after diagnosis and include the achievement of an optimal nutritional status to support the growth stages and puberty development in children, that will further support the maintenance of an optimal nutritional status in adult life. The cornerstone of nutrition in patients with CF is a high calorie, high-fat diet, in conjunction with a better control of malabsorption due to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, and attention to the adequate supplementation of fat-soluble vitamins. When the oral caloric intake is not enough for reaching the anthropometric nutritional goals, supplemental enteral feeding should be initiated to improve growth and the nutritional status. In the last decade, the therapeutic possibilities towards CF have grown in a consistent way. The positive effects of CFTR modulators on nutritional status mainly consist in the improvement in weight gain and BMI, both in children and adults, and in an amelioration in terms of the pulmonary function and reduction of exacerbations. Several challenges need to be overcome with the development of new drugs, to transform CF from a fatal disease to a treatable chronic disease with specialized multidisciplinary care.",36771186,PMC9921127,10.3390/nu15030479,,2023,"Mariotti Zani E, Grandinetti R, Cunico D, Torelli L, Fainardi V, Pisi G, Esposito S.",Y,MED

The frequency of the [L467F;F508del] complex allele among patients with homozygous F508del was determined with multiplex ligase-dependent probe amplification followed by polymerase chain reaction and fragment analysis. The function of ionic channels, including the residual CFTR function, and the effectiveness of CFTR modulators was analyzed using intestinal current measurements on rectal biopsy samples and the forskolin-induced swelling assay on organoids. The results showed that the F508del/[L467F;F508del] genotype is present in 8.2% of all Russian patients with F508del in a homozygous state. The clinical course of the disease in patients with the F508del/[L467F;F508del] genotype is severe and does not vary from the course in the cohort with homozygous F508del, although the CFTR channel function is significantly lower. For patients with the F508del/[L467F;F508del] genotype, we can recommend targeted therapy using a combined ivacaftor + tezacaftor + elexacaftor medication.",36142302,PMC9499621,10.3390/ijms231810377,,2022,"Kondratyeva E, Efremova A, Melyanovskaya Y, Voronkova A, Polyakov A, Bulatenko N, Adyan T, Sherman V, Kovalskaia V, Petrova N, Starinova M, Bukharova T, Kutsev S, Goldshtein D.",Y,MED
Personalized medicine with drugs targeting the underlying protein defect in cystic fibrosis: is monitoring of treatment response necessary?,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by two mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (*CFTR*) gene. In the last years, drugs targeting the underlying protein defect like lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) or tezacaftor/ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA) and more recently elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) were admitted. Outcome parameters evaluating therapy response like forced expiratory pressure in 1 s (FEV1), body mass index (BMI) or the efficacy of *CFTR* function in sweat glands showed improvement in several cases. Other, *CFTR* biomarkers were analysed rarely. This prospective observational study was aimed at evaluating *CFTR* function in patients treated with different *CFTR* modulators together with common valid clinical outcome parameters at standardized appointments (day 0, week 2, 4, 16). We followed four patients with the same mutation (*F508del-CFTR*), sex, age and disease severity. Monitoring focused on lung function, gastrointestinal aspects and *CFTR* function of sweat glands, nasal and intestinal epithelium. Sweat tests were performed by pilocarpine iontophoresis. Nasal potential difference (NPD) measured transepithelial voltage *in vivo* and potential increased when *CFTR* function improved. Rectal biopsies were obtained for intestinal current measurements (ICM) *ex vivo*. Intestinal *CFTR* function was assessed by stimulating chloride secretion with different reagents. Response to *CFTR* modulators regarding clinical outcome parameters was rather variable. A sweat chloride reduction of 35.3 mmol/L, nasal *CFTR* rescue of 4.4% and fivefold higher *CFTR* function in the intestine was seen at week 16 post-LUM/IVA. Due to our monitoring, we identified a non-responder to LUM/IVA and TEZ/IVA. In case of ELX/TEZ/IVA, clinical parameters and *CFTR* bioassays improved and were concordant. Although our cohort is small, results emphasize that non-responders exist and conclusions could not be drawn if patients were not monitored. Data on *CFTR* function can confirm or disprove ongoing *CFTR* dysfunction and might be helpful selectively. Non-responders need other alternative therapy options as demonstrated with ELX/TEZ/IVA.",35959505,PMC9358561,10.1177/20406223221108627,,2022,"Niedermayr K, Gasser V, Rueckes-Nilges C, Appelt D, Eder J, Fuchs T, Naehrlich L, Ellemunter H.",Y,MED
The influence of highly effective modulator therapies on the sputum proteome in cystic fibrosis,"ABSTRACT: Background: There have been dramatic clinical improvements in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients commenced on the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). Sputum proteomics is a powerful research technique capable of identifying important airway disease mechanisms. Using this technique, we evaluated how ETI changes the sputum proteome in people with CF. Methods: Sputum samples from 21 CF subjects pre- and post-ETI, 6 CF controls ineligible for ETI, and 15 healthy controls were analysed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Results: Post-ETI, mean FEV 1 % increased by 13.7% (SD 7.9). Principal component and hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that the post-ETI proteome shifted to an intermediate state that was distinct from pre-ETI and healthy controls, even for those achieving normal lung function. Functional analysis showed incomplete resolution of neutrophilic inflammation. The CF control sputum proteome did not alter. At the protein-level many more proteins increased in abundance than decreased following ETI therapy (80 vs 30; adjusted p value <0.05), including many that have anti-inflammatory properties. Of those proteins that reduced in abundance many were pro-inflammatory neutrophil-derived proteins. Several important respiratory proteases were unchanged. Conclusions: Sputum proteomics can provide insights into CF lung disease mechanisms and how they are modified by therapeutic intervention, in this case ETI. This study identifies imbalances in pro- and anti-inflammatory proteins in sputum that partially resolve with ETI even in those achieving normal spirometry values. This post-ETI intermediate state could contribute to ongoing airway damage and therefore its relevance to clinical outcomes needs to be established.",,,10.1101/2023.04.17.23288625,,2023,"Maher RE, Barry PJ, Emmott E, Jones AM, Lin L, McNamara PS, Smith JA, Lord RW.",Y,PPR
Airway inflammation accelerates pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis.,"Airway inflammation underlies cystic fibrosis (CF) pulmonary exacerbations. In a prospective multicenter study of randomly selected, clinically stable adolescents and adults, we assessed relationships between 24 inflammation-associated molecules and the future occurrence of CF pulmonary exacerbation using proportional hazards models. We explored relationships for potential confounding or mediation by clinical factors and assessed sensitivities to treatments including CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR) protein synthesis modulators. Results from 114 participants, including seven on ivacaftor or lumacaftor-ivacaftor, representative of the US CF population during the study period, identified 10 biomarkers associated with future exacerbations mediated by percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s. The findings were not sensitive to anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, and CFTR modulator treatments. The analyses suggest that combination treatments addressing RAGE-axis inflammation, protease-mediated injury, and oxidative stress might prevent pulmonary exacerbations. Our work may apply to other airway inflammatory diseases such as bronchiectasis and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.",38384849,PMC10879674,10.1016/j.isci.2024.108835,,2024,"Liou TG, Argel N, Asfour F, Brown PS, Chatfield BA, Cox DR, Daines CL, Durham D, Francis JA, Glover B, Helms M, Heynekamp T, Hoidal JR, Jensen JL, Kartsonaki C, Keogh R, Kopecky CM, Lechtzin N, Li Y, Lysinger J, Molina O, Nakamura C, Packer KA, Paine R, Poch KR, Quittner AL, Radford P, Redway AJ, Sagel SD, Szczesniak RD, Sprandel S, Taylor-Cousar JL, Vroom JB, Yoshikawa R, Clancy JP, Elborn JS, Olivier KN, Adler FR.",Y,MED
Sinus Disease Grading on Computed Tomography Before and After Modulating Therapy in Adult Patients with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Objectives: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy effects on respiratory function, pulmonary exacerbations and quality of life have been well documented. However, CFTR modulator therapy effects on sinus disease have not been so well reported. A previous study reported that ivacaftor improves appearance of sinus disease on Computed Tomography (CT) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with G551D mutation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CFTR modulator therapy in sinus disease using CT scores in a wider CF patient population.Materials and methods: Forty-eight adult patients with CF underwent at least one CT sinus examination before CFTR modulator therapy (ivacaftor, lumacaftor, ivacaftor/lumacaftor or elexcaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) and one CT sinus examination one year after CFTR modulator therapy initiation. Two radiologists assessed the images in consensus. The Lund-Mackay score (LM score) and the Sheikh-Lind CT sinus disease severity scoring system (SL score) were used. The 22-item SinoNasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) questionnaire was evaluated before CFTR modulator therapy and one year after CFTR modulator therapy initiation.Results: CT sinus examination after CFTR modulator therapy showed statistically significant lower mean LM, SL and SNOT-22 scores than CT sinus examination before CFTR modulator therapy (p < 0.001).Conclusion: Evolution of imaging findings on CT during follow-up closely correlate with improved SNOT-22 score one year after CFTR modulator therapy initiation, indicating that CT may be a useful adjunct during follow-up of CF patients under this treatment as an objective measure of sinonasal disease improvement.",35757498,PMC9205366,10.5334/jbsr.2812,,2022,"Tagliati C, Pantano S, Lanni G, Battista D, Marcucci M, Fogante M, Argalia G, Paci E, Pressanti GL, Ying M, Ripani P.",Y,MED

Esc peptides and derivatives potentiate the activity of CFTR with gating defects and display antipseudomonal activity in cystic fibrosis-like lung disease.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel with an important role in the airways. Despite the clinical efficacy of present modulators in restoring the activity of defective CFTR, there are patients who show persistent pulmonary infections, mainly due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Recently, we reported an unprecedented property of antimicrobial peptides i.e. Esc peptides, which consists in their ability to act as potentiators of CFTR carrying the most common mutation (the loss of phenylalanine 508) affecting protein folding, trafficking and gating. In this work, by electrophysiology experiments and computational studies, the capability of these peptides and de-novo designed analogs was demonstrated to recover the function of other mutated forms of CFTR which severely affect the channel gating (G551D and G1349D). This is presumably due to direct interaction of the peptides with the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) of CFTR, followed by a novel local phenomenon consisting in distancing residues located at the cytosolic side of the NBDs interface, thus stabilizing the open conformation of the pore at its cytosolic end. The most promising peptides for the dual antimicrobial and CFTR potentiator activities were also shown to display antipseudomonal activity in conditions mimicking the CF pulmonary ion transport and mucus obstruction, with a higher efficacy than the clinically used colistin. These studies should assist in development of novel drugs for lung pathology in CF, with dual CFTR potentiator and large spectrum antibiotic activities.",40100363,PMC11920571,10.1007/s00018-025-05633-9,,2025,"Ferrera L, Cappiello F, Venturini A, Lu H, Casciaro B, Cappella G, Bontempi G, Corrente A, Strippoli R, Zara F, Di YP, Galietta LJV, Mori M, Mangoni ML.",Y,MED
"Pregnancy in Cystic Fibrosis-Past, Present, and Future.","The introduction of mutation-specific therapy led to a revolution in cystic fibrosis (CF) care. These advances in CF therapies have changed the disease profile from a severe incurable disease with limited survival to a treatable disease with improved quality of life and survival into adulthood. CF patients are now able to plan their future, including marriage and parenthood. Side by side with the optimism, new issues and concerns are arising, including fertility and preparation for pregnancy, maternal and fetal care during pregnancy, and post-partum care. While cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) modulators show promising results for improving CF lung disease, data on their safety in pregnancy are still limited. We performed a literature review on pregnancy in CF from the past, with the first described pregnancy in 1960, through the current fascinating changes in the era of CFTR modulators, to ongoing studies and future directions.

Diabetes Outbreak During COVID19 Lock-down in a Prediabetic Patient with Cystic Fibrosis Long Treated With Glargine,"Abstract Background: Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD) is a frequent comorbidity of patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). A worsening of clinical conditions appears before CFRD. It has been demonstrated a decline in pulmonary function and nutritional status also in patients with prediabetes. Few trials show that insulin may be beneficial in prediabetic CF patients, to date guidelines do not recommended for this condition. Case presentation: we report a case of a patient treated with insulin glargine at 13, due to glycemic intolerance, and with Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor at 15. A reduction of pulmonary exacerbations was observed after glargine therapy, also confirmed after the starting of Lumacaftor/ Ivacaftor in this patient. Pulmonary function improved only after the first year of glargine therapy, then a deterioration appeared due to the natural history of CF lung damage. During the COVID-19 lockdown, poor adherence to care contributed to diabetes onset needing high insulin requirements. After two weeks the patient returned to prediabetic condition and his previous dose of glargine. Conclusions: our case highlights firstly that insulin glargine has contributed to preserve him from further clinical worsening due to prediabetes in the years before pandemic, secondly the negative impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the clinical course of a chronic disease as CF.",,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-139965/v1,,2021,"Rosanio FM, Mozzillo E, Cimbalo C, Casertano A, Sepe A, Raia V, Franzese A, Tosco A.",Y,PPR
The effect of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulators on impaired glucose tolerance and cystic fibrosis related diabetes.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder, with a prevalence of 1 in 2,500 live births. It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. With the significant advancement in CFTR-directed therapies, life expectancy of CF patients has steadily increased. With improved survival, CF related co-morbidities have become more apparent. The most common endocrine complication includes Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD). Impaired glucose tolerance and insulin deficiency in CFRD leads to a decline in pulmonary function in CF patients. Here we review the underlying mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of CFRD, focusing on the role of CFTR in the regulation of insulin secretion from the β-cell. We then discuss CFTR modulators and their effect on impaired glucose tolerance and CFRD.",35746945,PMC9209718,10.1016/j.jcte.2022.100301,,2022,"Hasan S, Khan MS, Lansang MC.",Y,MED
The gut-lung axis in the CFTR modulator era.,"The advent of CFTR modulators represents a turning point in the history of cystic fibrosis (CF) management, changing profoundly the disease's clinical course by improving mucosal hydration. Assessing changes in airway and digestive tract microbiomes is of great interest to better understand the mechanisms and to predict disease evolution. Bacterial and fungal dysbiosis have been well documented in patients with CF; yet the impact of CFTR modulators on microbial communities has only been partially deciphered to date. In this review, we aim to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of CFTR modulators on both pulmonary and digestive microbiomes. Our analysis also covers the inter-organ connections between lung and gut communities, in order to highlight the gut-lung axis involvement in CF pathophysiology and its evolution in the era of novel modulators therapies.",37780857,PMC10540301,10.3389/fcimb.2023.1271117,,2023,"Lussac-Sorton F, Charpentier É, Imbert S, Lefranc M, Bui S, Fayon M, Berger P, Enaud R, Delhaes L.",Y,MED
Predictive Value of 1-Hour Glucose Elevations during Oral Glucose Tolerance Testing for Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes.,"Background: In cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) screening, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) thresholds for detecting prediabetes and diabetes are defined by the 2-hour glucose (2 hG). Intermediate OGTT glucoses, between 0 and 2 hours, that are ≥200 mg/dL are deemed ""indeterminate,"" although lower 1-hour glucose (1 hG) thresholds identify those at increased risk of type 2 diabetes in other populations, and may also better predict clinical decline in CF. Studies of 1 hG thresholds <200 mg/dL in people with CF are limited.Methods: A single center, retrospective chart review was performed of patients with 1 hG available on OGTTs collected between 2010 and 2019. In patients with ≥2 OGTTs, Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated likelihood of progression to CFRD based on a high vs. low 1 hG. In patients with ≥1 OGTT, mixed-effects models tested whether baseline 1 hG and 2 hG predicted growth and lung function trajectories.Results: A total of 243 individuals with CF were identified with at least 1 OGTT including a 1 hG, and *n* = 177 had ≥2 OGTTs. Baseline age (mean ± SD) was 12.4 ± 2.6 years with 3.2 ± 1.4 years of follow-up. Twenty-eight developed CFRD. All who developed CFRD had a 1 hG ≥ 155 mg/dL prior to 2 hG > 140 mg/dL. The average 1 hG was 267 mg/dL when 2 hG ≥ 200 mg/dL. In a subset with baseline 2 hG < 140 mg/dL, 1 hG ≥ 140 mg/dL conferred an increased 5 years risk of CFRD (*p*=0.036). Baseline 2 hG predicted decline in FEV1%predicted, but 1 hG did not.Conclusions: In youth with CF, 1 hG ≥ 140 mg/dl is an early indicator of CFRD risk. However, 2 hG, rather than 1 hG, predicted lung function decline.",40303238,PMC12016879,10.1155/2023/4395556,,2023,"Lorenz AN, Pyle L, Ha J, Sherman A, Cree-Green M, Sagel SD, Nadeau KJ, Chan CL.",Y,MED
Precision Medicine Based on CFTR Genotype for People with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic condition that is caused by variants in the *cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator* gene. This causes multisystem disease due to dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel at the apical surface of epithelia. Until recently, treatment was directed at managing the downstream effects in affected organs, principally improving airway clearance and treating infection in the lungs and improving malabsorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Care delivered by multidisciplinary teams has yielded incremental improvements in outcomes. However, the development of small-molecule CFTR modulator drugs over the last decade has heralded a new era of CF therapeutics. Modulators target the underlying defect and improve CFTR function. Either monotherapy or a combination of modulators is used depending on the specific genotype and class of *CFTR* disease-causing variants that an individual has. Both ivacaftor and the ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor combination have been demonstrated to be associated with clinically very significant benefits in randomised trials and have rapidly been made available as part of standard care in many countries. CFTR modulators represent one of the best examples of precision medicine to date. They are expensive, however, and equity of access to them worldwide remains an issue. Studies and approvals are also ongoing for children under the age of 6 years for ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. Furthermore, no modulators are available for around 10% of the people with CF. In this review, we firstly summarise the genetics, pathophysiology and clinical problems associated with CF. We then discuss the development of CFTR modulators and key clinical trials to support their use along with other potential future therapeutic approaches.",35153502,PMC8828078,10.2147/pgpm.s245603,,2022,"Haq I, Almulhem M, Soars S, Poulton D, Brodlie M.",Y,MED
Inflammation and Infection in Cystic Fibrosis: Update for the Clinician.,"Inflammation and infection play an important role in the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis, and they are significant causes of morbidity and mortality in CF. The presence of thick mucus in the CF airways predisposes to local hypoxia and promotes infection and inflammation. A vicious cycle of airway obstruction, inflammation, and infection is of critical importance for the progression of the disease, and new data elucidate the different factors that influence it. Recent research has been focused on improving infection and inflammation in addition to correcting the basic gene defect. This review aims to summarize important advances in infection and inflammation as well as the effect of new treatments modulating the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein.

"CFTR modulator use and risk of nontuberculous mycobacteria positivity in cystic fibrosis, 2011-2018.","Background: People with cystic fibrosis are at increased risk of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) disease. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators are associated with reduced lung infection with pathogens like *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Staphylococcus aureus*. This association has not been studied with NTM.Methods: Using encounter-level data from the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry from 2011 to 2018, we identified individuals aged >12 years with one or more NTM-negative sputum culture and information on receipt of ivacaftor therapy. We used a Cox proportional hazards model to assess the relationship between CFTR modulator usage (any and monotherapy *versus* combination therapy) and NTM sputum culture positivity, controlling for sex, least severe class of CFTR mutation, receipt of chronic macrolides, age, body mass index and percentage predicted forced expiratory volume.Results: Out of 25 987 unique individuals, 17 403 individuals met inclusion criteria. During follow-up, 42% of individuals received CFTR modulator therapy, and 23% had incident NTM. The median (interquartile range) time to event was 6.1 (4.0-7.3) years for those ever receiving CFTR modulators compared to 4.0 (1.6-6.5) years in those never receiving CFTR modulators. CFTR modulator use was associated with a significantly reduced hazard of NTM culture positivity (hazard ratio (HR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.97); there was no significant difference in the hazard between those receiving ivacaftor monotherapy *versus* combination therapy (combination HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.79-1.23).Conclusions: CFTR modulator therapy is associated with a decreased risk of NTM positivity in individuals with cystic fibrosis.",35415188,PMC8995538,10.1183/23120541.00724-2021,,2022,"Ricotta EE, Prevots DR, Olivier KN.",Y,MED
Real-life efficacy and safety of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor on severe cystic fibrosis lung disease patients.,"Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) is a cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator modulator, which has shown efficacy in CF patients (≥6 years) with ≥1 Phe508del mutation and a minimal function mutation. In October 2019, ETI became available on compassionate use basis for Dutch CF patients with severe lung disease. Our objective was to investigate safety and efficacy of ETI in this patient group in a real-life setting. A multicenter longitudinal observational study was conducted to examine changes in FEV1 , BMI, and adverse events at initiation and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after starting ETI. The number of exacerbations was recorded in the 12 months before and the 12 months after ETI treatment. Patients eligible for compassionate use had a FEV1 <40% predicted. Wilcoxon signed-rank test analyzed changes over time. Twenty subjects were included and followed up for up to 12 months after starting ETI. Treatment was well tolerated with mild side effects reported, namely, rash (15%) and stomach ache (20%) with 80% resolving within 1 month. Mean absolute increase of FEV1 was 11.8/13.7% (p ≤ .001) and BMI was 0.49/1.87 kg/m2 (p < .001-0.02) after 1/12 months, respectively. In comparison to the number of exacerbations pretrial, there was a marked reduction in exacerbations after initiation. Our findings show long-term effects of treatment with ETI in patients with severe CF lung disease in a real-life setting.

Nutritional Status and Circulating Levels of Fat-Soluble Vitamins in Cystic Fibrosis Patients: A Cohort Study and Evaluation of the Effect of CFTR Modulators.,"Background: Improved therapy in CF has led to an overall improvement in nutritional status. The objectives of our study are: to cross-sectionally assess nutritional status and serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins; to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy of modulators on nutritional status and fat-soluble vitamin levels.Methods: In patients younger than 2 years of age, we evaluated growth, in patients aged 2-18 years, we assessed BMI z-scores, and in adults, we assessed absolute BMI values. Levels of 25(OH)D, vitamins A, and E were measured.Results: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 318 patients, 109 (34.3%) with pancreatic sufficiency. Only three patients were under 2 years old. In 135 patients aged 2-18 years, the median BMI z-score was 0.11, and 5 (3.7%) patients had malnutrition (z-score ≤ 2SD). In 180 adults, the median BMI was 21.8 kg/m2. Overall, 15 (13.7%) males (M) and 18 (25.3%) females (F) were underweight (18 < BMI > 20); 3 (2.7%) M and 5 (7.0%) F had a BMI < 18. Suboptimal 25(OH)D levels were found in patients with pancreatic insufficiency. The prevalence of deficiency of vitamins A and E is low. After one year of treatment with modulators, the increase in BMI was more consistent (M: 1.58 ± 1.25 kg/m2 F: 1.77 ± 1.21 kg/m2) in elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI)-treated patients compared with other modulators, with a significant increase in levels of all fat-soluble vitamins.Conclusions: Malnutrition is present in a limited number of subjects.

Exhaled Breath Analysis Detects the Clearance of *Staphylococcus aureus* from the Airways of Children with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Background: Electronic nose (eNose) technology can be used to characterize volatile organic compound (VOC) mixes in breath. While previous reports have shown that eNose can detect lung infections with pathogens such as *Staphylococcus aureus* (SA) in people with cystic fibrosis (CF), the clinical utility of eNose for longitudinally monitoring SA infection status is unknown.Methods: In this longitudinal study, a cloud-connected eNose, the SpiroNose, was used for the breath profile analysis of children with CF at two stable visits and compared based on changes in SA infection status between visits. Data analysis involved advanced sensor signal processing, ambient correction, and statistics based on the comparison of breath profiles between baseline and follow-up visits.Results: Seventy-two children with CF, with a mean (IQR) age of 13.8 (9.8-16.4) years, were studied. In those with SA-positive airway cultures at baseline but SA-negative cultures at follow-up (*n* = 19), significant signal differences were detected between Baseline and Follow-up at three distinct eNose sensors, i.e., S4 (*p* = 0.047), S6 (*p* = 0.014), and S7 (*p* = 0.014).

Effects of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor therapy on mental health of patients with cystic fibrosis.,"**Introduction:** The CFTR modulator drug elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) was shown to improve CFTR function and clinical symptoms in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) with at least one *F508del* allele. Recently, some case reports suggested potential side effects of ETI on mental health with an increase in depressive symptoms and even suicide attempts in patients with CF. However, the general effects of this triple combination therapy on the mental health status of patients with CF remain largely unknown. **Methods:** We, therefore, performed a prospective, observational study in a real-life setting and investigated the relationship between initiation of ETI therapy and changes in mental health in adult patients with CF. We assessed Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Beck's Depression Inventory - Fast Screen (BDI-FS) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale (GAD-7) at baseline and 8-16 weeks after initiation of ETI. **Results:** In total, 70 adult patients with CF with at least one *F508del* allele and a median age of 27.9 years were recruited. After initiation of ETI, the CFQ-R respiratory domain score improved by 27.9 (IQR 5.6 to 47.2; *p* < 0.001). The PHQ-9 score of depressive symptoms decreased by 1.0 (IQR -3.0 to 0.3; *p* < 0.05) with an increase of 16.9% in the group with a minimal score after initiation of ETI and a decrease in the groups of mild (-11.3%) or moderate (-5.7%) scores compared to baseline. The BDI-FS score of depressive symptoms decreased from 1.0 (IQR 0.0-2.0) at baseline to 0.0 (IQR 0.0 to 2.0; *p* < 0.05) after initiation of ETI. The group with a minimal BDI-FS score increased by 8.0% after initiation of ETI, whereas the groups with mild (-4.9%), moderate (-1.6%) or severe (-1.6%) scores decreased compared to baseline. The GAD-7 score of anxiety symptoms did not change after initiation of ETI compared to baseline (0.0; IQR -2.0. to 0.0; *p* = 0.112). **Conclusion:** Initiation of ETI improves symptoms of depression in adult patients with CF with at least one *F508del* allele. However, symptoms of anxiety do not change after short-term therapy with ETI.",37153809,PMC10160464,10.3389/fphar.2023.1179208,,2023,"Piehler L, Thalemann R, Lehmann C, Thee S, Röhmel J, Syunyaeva Z, Stahl M, Mall MA, Graeber SY.",Y,MED
Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor corrects monocyte microbicidal deficiency in cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF), which is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), is characterised by chronic bacterial lung infection and inflammation. In CF, monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages have been shown to display defective phagocytosis and antimicrobial activity against relevant lung pathogens, including *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. Thus, we addressed the effect of CFTR triple modulator therapy (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI)) on the activity of CF monocytes against *P. aeruginosa*.Methods: Monocytes from people with CF (PWCF) before and after 1 and 6 months of ETI therapy were isolated from blood and infected with *P. aeruginosa* to assess phagocytic activity and intracellular bacterial killing. The oxidative burst and interleukin-6 secretion were also determined. Monocytes from healthy controls were also included.Results: Longitudinal analysis of the clinical parameters confirmed an improvement of lung function and lung microbiology by ETI. Both the phagocytic and microbicidal deficiencies of CF monocytes also improved significantly, although not completely. Furthermore, we measured an exuberant oxidative burst in CF monocytes before therapy, which was reduced considerably by ETI. This led to an improvement of reactive oxygen species-dependent bactericidal activity. Inflammatory response to bacterial stimuli was also lowered compared with pre-therapy.Conclusions: PWCF on ETI therapy, in a real-life setting, in addition to clinical recovery, showed significant improvement in monocyte activity against *P. aeruginosa*, which may have contributed to the overall effect of ETI on pulmonary disease. This also suggests that CF monocyte dysfunctions may be specifically targeted to ameliorate lung function in CF.",36455959,PMC10066567,10.1183/13993003.00725-2022,,2023,"Cavinato L, Luly FR, Pastore V, Chiappetta D, Sangiorgi G, Ferrara E, Baiocchi P, Mandarello G, Cimino G, Del Porto P, Ascenzioni F.",Y,MED

Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis Homozygous for the *F508del* Mutation and Advanced Lung Disease: A 48-Week Observational Study.,"Background: Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) is the newest cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) modulator drug approved for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) aged ≥6 years with at least one copy of the *F508del* mutation (*F*) in the *CFTR* gene or another mutation that is responsive to treatment with ETI. This study determined the effectiveness and safety of ETI in a cohort of severely affected pwCF with an *F/F* genotype.Methods: Retrospective observational study in *F/F* pwCF treated for 48 weeks, enrolled in an ETI managed access program available to subjects with advanced lung disease (ppFEV1 < 40). Twenty-six patients from three centres were included. The main outcomes included lung function, sweat chloride concentration (SCC), nutrition, frequency of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), CFQ-R, and safety.Results: ppFEV1 improved by 12.06 (95%CI 8.54, 15.57) from baseline after 4 weeks of treatment with ETI, 15.32 (11.3, 19.34) after 24 weeks, and 14.48 (10.64, 18.32) after 48 weeks. The increase in FEV1 was accompanied by a decrease in SCC, improvement of BMI, and noticeable reduction in PEx.

Short-Term Effects of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor Combination on Glucose Tolerance in Young People With Cystic Fibrosis-An Observational Pilot Study.,"Background: The effect of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) on glucose tolerance and/or cystic-fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is not well understood. We performed an observational study on the short-term effects of ELX/TEZ/IVA on glucose tolerance.Methods: Sixteen adolescents with CF performed oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) before and 4-6 weeks after initiating ELX/TEZ/IVA therapy. A continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system was used 3 days before until 7 days after starting ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment.Results: OGTT categories improved after initiating ELX/TEZ/IVA therapy (*p* = 0.02). Glucose levels of OGTT improved at 60, 90, and 120 min (*p* < 0.05), whereas fasting glucose and CGM measures did not change.Conclusion: Shortly after initiating ELX/TEZ/IVA therapy, glucose tolerance measured by OGTT improved in people with CF.

Association of vitamin A status with lung function in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis.,"Importance: Vitamin A (or retinol) has considerable antioxidative and anti-inflammatory attributes and it may have protective effects on the respiratory health of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). This issue, however, remains controversial.Objective: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between serum retinol levels (SRL) and force expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in patients with CF.Methods: All patients with pancreatic insufficiency attending the CF Department of ""Agia Sofia"" Children's Hospital in Athens, Greece, aged 6 to 19 years during the 2012-2016 period, who could perform spirometry effectively, were included in the study. The impact of SRL on FEV1 was examined longitudinally and analyzed with generalized estimating equations.Results: The study included 231 patients and 851 SRL measurements were performed. In 25 (3.2%) cases the SRL were below the 5th percentile of reference distribution; none was above the 95th percentile. The analysis showed that SRL was positively correlated with the FEV1 (*P* *<* 0.001).Interpretation: In this sample of children and adolescents with CF, vitamin A deficiency was rare.

The effect of CFTR modulators on structural lung disease in cystic fibrosis.,"**Background:** Newly developed quantitative chest computed tomography (CT) outcomes designed specifically to assess structural abnormalities related to cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease are now available. CFTR modulators potentially can reduce some structural lung abnormalities. We aimed to investigate the effect of CFTR modulators on structural lung disease progression using different quantitative CT analysis methods specific for people with CF (PwCF). **Methods:** PwCF with a gating mutation (Ivacaftor) or two Phe508del alleles (lumacaftor-ivacaftor) provided clinical data and underwent chest CT scans. Chest CTs were performed before and after initiation of CFTR modulator treatment. Structural lung abnormalities on CT were assessed using the Perth Rotterdam Annotated Grid Morphometric Analysis for CF (PRAGMA-CF), airway-artery dimensions (AA), and CF-CT methods. Lung disease progression (0-3 years) in exposed and matched unexposed subjects was compared using analysis of covariance. To investigate the effect of treatment in early lung disease, subgroup analyses were performed on data of children and adolescents aged <18 years. **Results:** We included 16 modulator exposed PwCF and 25 unexposed PwCF. Median (range) age at the baseline visit was 12.55 (4.25-36.49) years and 8.34 (3.47-38.29) years, respectively. The change in PRAGMA-CF %Airway disease (-2.88 (-4.46, -1.30), *p* = 0.001) and %Bronchiectasis extent (-2.07 (-3.13, -1.02), *p* < 0.001) improved in exposed PwCF compared to unexposed. Subgroup analysis of paediatric data showed that only PRAGMA-CF %Bronchiectasis (-0.88 (-1.70, -0.07), *p* = 0.035) improved in exposed PwCF compared to unexposed. **Conclusion:** In this preliminary real-life retrospective study CFTR modulators improve several quantitative CT outcomes.

The impact of rare diseases on the quality of life in paediatric patients: current status.,"Rare diseases, also known as orphan diseases, are a group of disorders that affect a small percentage of the population. Despite individually affecting a small number of people, collectively, they impact millions worldwide. This is particularly significant in paediatric patients, highlighting the global scale of the issue. This review delves into the exact prevalence of rare diseases among children and adolescents and their diverse impact on the quality of life of patients and their families. The review sheds light on the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors contributing to these conditions and the diagnostic challenges and delays often encountered in identifying and categorising these diseases. It is noted that although there have been significant strides in the field of genomic medicine and the development of orphan drugs, effective treatments remain limited. This necessitates a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to management involving various specialities working closely together to provide holistic care. Furthermore, the review addresses the psychosocial and economic burdens faced by families with paediatric patients suffering from rare diseases, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced support mechanisms. Recent technological and therapeutic advancements, including genomic sequencing and personalized medicine, offer promising avenues for improving patient outcomes. Additionally, the review underscores the role of policy and advocacy in advancing research, ensuring healthcare access, and supporting affected families. It emphasises the importance of increased awareness, education, and collaboration among healthcare providers, researchers, policymakers, and patient advocacy groups. It stresses the pivotal role each group plays in improving the diagnosis, treatment, and overall quality of life for paediatric patients with rare diseases.",40196857,PMC11973084,10.3389/fpubh.2025.1531583,,2025,"Dumbuya JS, Zeng C, Deng L, Li Y, Chen X, Ahmad B, Lu J.",Y,MED

Pediatric population with cystic fibrosis in the centre of Portugal: candidates for new therapies.,"Objectives: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a severe autosomal recessive disease that results from mutations in a gene encoding the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein, a chloride channel. This study aims to characterize the clinical and genetic features of a cohort of pediatric people with CF (PwCF) in the center of Portugal and to determine which ones are candidates for the new drugs modulating the CFTR channel.Methods: A review of the demographic, genetic and clinical characteristics of PwCF undergoing follow-up at a CF reference center was carried out.Results: Twenty-three PwCF (12 male), with a median age of 12 years, were followed up. All patients carry the F508del mutation in at least one allele. Fifteen PwCF were F508del-homozygous, median BMI z-score was -0.13, all are pancreatic insufficient and median FEV1 value was 78.1%. These PwCF are eligible for dual therapy (lumacaftor/tezacaftor+ivacaftor) and for triple therapy (tezacaftor+ivacaftor+elexacaftor). PwCF with 711 +1G->T (n = 2), 2184insA (n = 1) mutations and a novel mutation c.3321dup (n = 1) have minimal function mutation and patients with a residual function mutation: R334W (n = 3) and P5L (n = 1) have a less severe phenotype. All these patients, because they also carry F508del mutation, are elegible to triple therapy.Conclusions: Genetic and molecular characterization of PwCF poses an important step not just for CF diagnosis and prognosis which is tightly correlated with the clinical phenotype, but also for the eligibility of CFTR modulator drugs.",34252371,PMC9432345,10.1016/j.jped.2021.05.010,,2022,"Roda J, Teixeira T, Ai Silva I, Silva TR, Ferreira R, Amaral MD, Oliveira G.",Y,MED
Obstructive sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoxemia in adult patients with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), nocturnal hypoxemia and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are common comorbidities in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). Most of the data showing this originates from children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to collect data on sleep parameters, EDS and pulmonary function from a large cohort of adult pwCF.Methods: Full overnight polysomnography (PSG) was performed. EDS was determined using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Demographic and clinical data (body mass index [BMI], pulmonary function, capillary blood gases) were collected.Results: A total of 52 adult pwCF were included (mean age 30.7 ± 8.0 years, mean percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s [ppFEV1] of 52.1 ± 14.8). Overall AHI was in the normal range (4.5 ± 4.0/h); 21/52 pwCF (40%) had an apnea-hypopnea index > 5/h. Nocturnal hypoxemia was found in 25% of participants and this was associated with ppFEV1 (p = 0.014), awake oxygen saturation (SpO2; p = 0.021) and awake partial pressure of oxygen (pO2; p = 0.003); there were no significant differences in age, lung function and BMI were found for pwCF with versus without OSA (all p > 0.05). Eight pwCF (15%) had an ESS score > 10 (indicating EDS). OSA was best predicted by awake pO2 (area under the curve [AUC] 0.66, p = 0.048), while nocturnal hypoxemia was best predicted by ppFEV1 (AUC 0.74, p = 0.009), awake pO2 (AUC 0.76, p = 0.006) and awake SpO2 (AUC 0.71; p = 0.025).Conclusion: OSA, nocturnal hypoxemia and EDS were common in adult pwCF, but no strong predictors were identified. Therefore, we suggest regular PSG and ESS scoring in adult pwCF, regardless of disease severity.",36437445,PMC9703664,10.1186/s12890-022-02243-0,,2022,"Welsner M, Dietz-Terjung S, Stehling F, Schulte T, Niehammer U, Gahbiche FE, Taube C, Strassburg S, Schoebel C, Weinreich G, Sutharsan S.",Y,MED
CF Fungal Disease in the Age of CFTR Modulators.,"Fungi are increasingly recognised to have a significant role in the progression of lung disease in Cystic fibrosis with Aspergillus fumigatus the most common fungus isolated during respiratory sampling. The emergence of novel CFTR modulators has, however, significantly changed the outlook of disease progression in CF. In this review we discuss what impact novel CFTR modulators will have on fungal lung disease and its management in CF. We discuss how CFTR modulators affect antifungal innate immunity and consider the impact of Ivacaftor on fungal disease in individuals with gating mutations. We further review the increasing complication of drug-drug interactions with concurrent use of azole antifungal medication and highlight key unknowns that require addressing to fully understand the impact of CFTR modulators on fungal disease.",33813719,PMC8536598,10.1007/s11046-021-00541-5,,2021,"Bercusson A, Jarvis G, Shah A.",Y,MED
Calibration and validation of modeled 5-year survival predictions among people with cystic fibrosis treated with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator ivacaftor using United States registry data.,"Objectives: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare genetic disease characterized by life-shortening lung function decline. Ivacaftor, a CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulator (CFTRm), was approved in 2012 for people with CF with specific gene mutations. We used real-world evidence of 5-year mortality impacts of ivacaftor in a US registry population to validate a CF disease-progression model that estimates the impact of ivacaftor on survival.Methods: The model projects the impact of ivacaftor vs. standard care in people with CF aged ≥6 years with CFTR gating mutations by combining parametric equations fitted to historical registry survival data, with mortality hazards adjusted for fixed and time-varying person-level characteristics. Disease progression with standard care was derived from published registry studies and the expected impact of ivacaftor on clinical characteristics was derived from clinical trials. Individual-level baseline characteristics of the registry ivacaftor-treated population were entered into the model; 5-year model-projected mortality with credible intervals (CrIs) was compared with registry mortality to evaluate the model's validity.Results: Post-calibration 5-year mortality projections closely approximated registry mortality in populations treated with standard care (6.4% modeled [95% CrI: 5.3% to 7.6%] vs. 6.0% observed) and ivacaftor (3.4% modeled [95% CrI: 2.7% to 4.4%] vs. 3.1% observed). The model accurately predicted 5-year relative risk of mortality (0.53 modeled [0.47 to 0.60] vs. 0.51 observed) in people treated with ivacaftor vs. standard care.Conclusions: Modeled 5-year survival projections for people with CF initiating ivacaftor vs. standard care align closely with real-world registry data. Findings support the validity of modeling CF to predict long-term survival and estimate clinical and economic outcomes of CFTRm.",37043485,PMC10096446,10.1371/journal.pone.0283479,,2023,"McGarry LJ, Bhaiwala Z, Lopez A, Chandler C, Pelligra CG, Rubin JL, Liou TG.",Y,MED

"Effect of Trikafta on bone density, body composition and exercise capacity in CF: A pilot study.","Background: While the positive effect of Trikafta on cystic fibrosis (CF) pulmonary disease is well established, there is limited data about its effect on bone mineral density (BMD), body composition and exercise capacity.Methods: A pilot single center study. BMD and body composition were measured three months after the initiation of Trikafta (study group) and compared to values obtained 2 years earlier. CF patients not treated with Trikafta, for whom BMD was measured 2 years apart, served as controls. Spirometry, lung clearance index (LCI), sweat test, six-min walk test (6MWT) and cardio-pulmonary exercise test (CPET) were performed before and three months after the initiation of Trikafta.Results: Nine study patients, aged 18.6 ± 4.7 years, and nine controls. For the study group, BMI and hip and spine BMD increased significantly (19.4 ± 2.6 to 20.3 ± 2.19 BMI, p = 0.05; 0.73 ± 0.098 to 0.81 ± 0.12 gr/cm2 hip, p = 0.017; 0.76 ± 0.14 to 0.82 ± 0.14 gr/cm2 spine, p = 0.025). For the control group, there was no difference in hip or spine BMD. Lean body mass, %fat z-score and fat mass/height2 z-score increased significantly (34770.23 ± 10521.21 to 37430.16 ± 10330.09gr, p = 0.017; -0.8 ± 0.75 to 0.46 ± 0.58, p = 0.012; and -0.98 ± 0.66 to -0.04 ± 0.51, p = 0.025, respectively). 6MWT improved from 541.1 ± 48.9 to 592.9 ± 54.5 m (p = 0.046). As expected, FEV1%pred increased (p = 0.008) and sweat chloride decreased significantly (p = 0.017). In CPET, VE/VCO2 improved, indicating better ventilatory efficiency.Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the metabolic effects of Trikafta.

"Time Free From Hospitalization in Children and Adolescents With Cystic Fibrosis: Findings From FEV1, Lung Clearance Index and Peak Work Rate.","Background: An exercise test combined with a multiple breath washout nitrogen test (MBWN2) may offer a comprehensive clinical evaluation of cystic fibrosis (CF) disease in children with normal spirometry. The purpose of the present study is to explore whether information derived from spirometry, MBWN2, and exercise tests can help the CF multidisciplinary team to characterize time free from hospitalization due to pulmonary exacerbation (PE) in a cohort of pediatric patients with CF.Methods: This prospective observational study was carried out at the Lombardia Region Reference Center for Cystic Fibrosis in Milano, Italy. In 2015, we consecutively enrolled children and adolescents aged <18 years with spirometry, MBWN2, and Godfrey exercise test performed during an outpatient visit.Results: Over a median follow-up time of 2.2 years (interquartile range [IQR], 2.01; 3.18), 28 patients aged between 13.0 and 17.4 years were included. When lung functions were outside the normal range, 50% of patients were hospitalized 4 months after the outpatient visit, and their response to exercise was abnormal (100%). Half of the individuals with normal forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and abnormal lung clearance index (LCI) experienced the first hospital admission 9 months after the clinic visit, and 84.2% presented an abnormal response to exercise. Conversely, 15.8% had abnormal exercise responses when lung functions were considered normal, with half of the adolescents hospitalized at 11 months.Conclusion: Maintaining ventilation homogeneity, along with a normal ability to sustain intense work, may have a positive impact on the burden of CF disease, here conceived as time free from hospitalization due to PE.",35813385,PMC9257036,10.3389/fped.2022.926248,,2022,"Gambazza S, Mariani A, Brivio A, Carta F, Blardone C, Lisiero S, Russo M, Colombo C.",Y,MED
Frequency of CFTR variants in southern Brazil and indication for modulators therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis.,"This is a descriptive cross-sectional study that aims to determine the distribution of the CFTR causing variant in a group of patients at a cystic fibrosis (CF) center in southern Brazil, as well as to describe causing variants that are treatable with mutation-specific drugs. Ninety-two patients from a CF reference center were assessed in this research, all of them with a clinical diagnosis of CF and both alleles identified with pathogenic variants. The most prevalent causing variants were F508del, R1162X, G542X, and N1303K. As for patients with a mutation-specific drug indication, 69.6 % were candidates for the use of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (Trikafta®), 44.6 % for the use of Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (Symdeko®), and 35.9 % for the use of Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor (Orkambi®). For the use of Ivacaftor (Kalydeco®), only two patients (2.2 %) were candidates following the Brazilian agency approval. According to the FDA, 10 patients would be candidates for Ivacaftor (10.9 %). Causing variants of classes I and II, which are related to a major severity of the illness, were identified in 135 of 184 alleles (73.3 %).

Efficacy and Safety of Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor in the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis: A Systematic Review.,"Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) is a new CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) modulator treatment, used over the last few years, which has shown an improvement in different clinical outcomes in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The objective of this study was a systematic research of the literature on the efficacy and safety of this CFTR modulator on patients with CF. A search of Pubmed was conducted for randomized clinical trials and observational studies published from 2012 to September 2022. The included full manuscripts comprised nine clinical trials and 16 observational studies, whose participants were aged ≥12 years or were children 6-11 years old with at least one Phe508del mutation and/or advanced lung disease (ALD). These studies reported that ELX/TEZ/IVA has a significant positive effect on the lung function of patients with CF, by ameliorating parameters such as FEV1, LCI, pulmonary exacerbations or sweat chloride concentration, increasing BMI and improving quality of their life. Its role in cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is not yet clear. It was found that this new CFTR modulator has an overall favorable safety profile, with mild to moderate adverse events. Further studies are needed for a deeper understanding of the impact of CFTR modulators on other CF manifestations, or the possibility of treating with ELX/TEZ/IVA CF patients with rare CFTR mutations.",36980112,PMC10047761,10.3390/children10030554,,2023,"Kapouni N, Moustaki M, Douros K, Loukou I.",Y,MED
Biofilm infection of a central venous port-catheter caused by Mycobacterium avium complex in an immunocompetent child with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Mycobacterium (M.) chimaera is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) that belongs to M. avium complex (MAC). In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), MAC can cause bronchopulmonary infections that can be prolonged and difficult to treat. MAC infections of sites other than the lungs or central catheters are rare and almost exclusively associated with immunodeficiency.Case presentation: We present a case of an 8-year-old CF patient (delF508 homozygous) with recurrent pulmonary exacerbations, gradual clinical deterioration, B-symptoms (fever, fatigue, weight loss, night sweat), elevated transaminases and intermittent detection of M. chimaera in the sputum without radiological signs of NTM-associated lung disease with a central venous port-catheter. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed M. chimaera port infection that was also confirmed by mycobacterial culture. The patient recovered within 4 weeks after removal of the catheter and initiation of MAC targeted antimicrobial therapy. Electron microscopy of the catheter illustrated the presence of mycobacteria in a biofilm.Conclusions: MAC central venous catheter infection needs to be considered in immunocompetent people. NGS is a valuable tool for rapid identification of rare infections. MAC capability of biofilm formation renders catheter removal the central therapeutic intervention for the clearance of the infection.",36494632,PMC9733094,10.1186/s12879-022-07899-x,,2022,"Kavvalou A, Stehling F, Tschiedel E, Kehrmann J, Walkenfort B, Hasenberg M, Olivier M, Steindor M.",Y,MED
Screening by high-throughput sequencing for pathogenic variants in cystic fibrosis: Benefit of introducing personalized therapies.,"This short report documented cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) variants in 37 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) in the Rio Grande do Norte region of Northeast Brazil. The high-throughput sequencing technology (HTS) genetic testing provided a definitive molecular diagnosis in 31 patients (83.8%). Among them, 25 patients' carriers of the c.1521_1523delCTT variant, categorized as a class 2 mutation, can be currently treated with CFTR modulator drugs. Five children aged 2-5 years could benefit from double lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy, and 20 patients aged >6 years could be treated with the triple-combination elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor therapy. Thus, the identification of pathogenic variants associated with the development of this disease allows for the introduction of therapy with CFTR modulators that favour better patient management.",36369753,PMC9716207,10.1111/jcmm.17605,,2022,"de Melo ACV, de Souza KSC, da Silva HPV, Maia JMC, Dantas VM, Bezerra JF, de Rezende AA.",Y,MED
Modulation of Plasmatic Matrix Metalloprotease 9: A Promising New Tool for Understanding the Variable Clinical Responses of Patients with Cystic Fibrosis to Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Modulators.,"Background: The most recent modulator combination, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Trikafta®), has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in most patients with cystic fibrosis (PwCF). Unfortunately, the clinical benefits are sometimes variable; thus, improving our knowledge of the possible causes of this variability can help reduce it.Methods: Circulating mononuclear cells (CMCs) and plasma were collected from 16 PwCF (including those on Trikafta® therapy) and 4 non-CF subjects. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) activity and matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9) expression were monitored before and after therapy, together with some clinical parameters. The relationship between MMP9 expression and the modulation of the extracellular-regulated 1/2 (ERK1/2) and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) pathways was also analyzed.Results: MMP9, markedly expressed in the CMCs and plasma of all the patients included in the study, was downregulated in the clinically responsive PwCF. In the non-responder, the MMP9 levels remained high. The modulation of MMP9 following treatment with Trikafta® may be controlled by the NF-kB pathway.Conclusions: These data strongly suggest that MMP9 downregulation is a potential biomarker of therapy efficacy and that it could be useful in understanding the molecular events underlying the variable clinical responses of patients to Trikafta®. This knowledge could be helpful for future studies of personalized medicine and thereby ensure improvements in individual responses to therapies.",37686190,PMC10488059,10.3390/ijms241713384,,2023,"Capraro M, Pedrazzi M, De Tullio R, Manfredi M, Cresta F, Castellani C, Averna M.",Y,MED
Olive Leaf Extract (OLE) as a Novel Antioxidant That Ameliorates the Inflammatory Response in Cystic Fibrosis.,"The deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del) produces a misfolded CFTR protein that is retained in the ER and degraded. The lack of normal CFTR channel activity is associated with chronic infection and inflammation which are the primary causes of declining lung function in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. Moreover, LPS-dependent oxidative stress downregulates CFTR function in airway epithelial cells. Olive leaf extract (OLE) is used in traditional medicine for its effects, including anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory ones. We found that OLE decreased the intracellular ROS levels in a dose-response manner in CFBE cells. Moreover, OLE attenuates the inflammatory response to LPS or IL-1β/TNFα stimulation, mimicking the infection and inflammatory status of CF patients, in CFBE and primary nasal epithelial (HNE) cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that OLE restored the LPS-mediated decrease of TrikfaftaTM-dependent F508del-CFTR function in CFBE and HNE cultures. These findings provide strong evidence of OLE to prevent redox imbalance and inflammation that can cause chronic lung damage by enhancing the antioxidant activity and attenuating inflammation in CF airway epithelial cells. Additionally, OLE might be used in combination with CFTR modulators therapy to improve their efficacy in CF patients.",37443798,PMC10340374,10.3390/cells12131764,,2023,"Allegretta C, Difonzo G, Caponio F, Tamma G, Laselva O.",Y,MED
A nonnatural peptide targeting the A-kinase anchoring function of PI3Kγ for therapeutic cAMP modulation in pulmonary cells.,"A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) are key orchestrators of cAMP signaling that act by recruiting protein kinase A (PKA) in proximity of its substrates and regulators to specific subcellular compartments. Modulation of AKAPs function offers the opportunity to achieve compartment-restricted modulation of the cAMP/PKA axis, paving the way to new targeted treatments. For instance, blocking the AKAP activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ) improves lung function by inducing cAMP-mediated bronchorelaxation, ion transport, and antiinflammatory responses. Here, we report the generation of a nonnatural peptide, D-retroinverso (DRI)-Pep #20, optimized to disrupt the AKAP function of PI3Kγ. DRI-Pep #20 mimicked the native interaction between the N-terminal domain of PI3Kγ and PKA, demonstrating nanomolar affinity for PKA, high resistance to protease degradation and high permeability to the pulmonary mucus barrier. DRI-Pep #20 triggered cAMP elevation both in vivo in the airway tract of mice upon intratracheal administration, and in vitro in bronchial epithelial cells of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. In CF cells, DRI-Pep #20 rescued the defective function of the cAMP-operated channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, by boosting the efficacy of approved cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulators. Overall, this study unveils DRI-Pep #20 as a potent PI3Kγ/PKA disruptor for achieving therapeutic cAMP elevation in chronic respiratory disorders.",39393573,PMC11585760,10.1016/j.jbc.2024.107873,,2024,"Della Sala A, Tasca L, Butnarasu C, Sala V, Prono G, Murabito A, Garbero OV, Millo E, Terranova L, Blasi F, Gramegna A, Aliberti S, Massarotti A, Visentin S, Hirsch E, Ghigo A.",Y,MED
"Maternal, newborn and breast milk concentrations of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in a F508del heterozygous woman with cystic fibrosis following successful pregnancy.","With the introduction of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), more women with cystic fibrosis (CF) are likely to grow families. Hence, an understanding long-term safety and effects of CFTR modulators on fertile women and children while monitoring their concentrations is crucial. Here, we report on the development of an improved LC-MS/MS methodology to measure ETI concentrations in maternal and child blood and breastmilk, applied in one case of successful pregnancy of a 30-year-old woman with CF (F508del/R334W). We observed that ETI remains stable in breastmilk, is absorbed by the infant and can be detected in child plasma. Our results confirm accumulating evidence of a successful pregnancy in women treated with CFTR modulators without significant side effects on the child and provide valuable analytical procedures suitable for the post-marketing evaluation of CFTR modulators in pregnant and lactating women, as well as in their infants.",38131041,PMC10734635,10.3389/fmed.2023.1274303,,2023,"Ripani P, Mucci M, Pantano S, Di Sabatino M, Collini F, Ferri G, Romano M, Recchiuti A.",Y,MED
Elexacaftor - Tezacaftor - Ivacaftor treatment improves systemic infection parameters and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* colonization rate in patients with cystic fibrosis a monocentric observational study.,"Background & aims: The CFTR-modulating therapy Elexaftor - Tezacaftor - Ivacaftor (ETI) has been widely prescribed since its approval in 2020 in the European Union. The aim of this study was to methodically evaluate the effects of an ETI treatment on clinical, biochemical data and Pseudomonas colonization in order to demonstrate its efficacy.Methods: This prospective monocentric study comprised 69 patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis aged at least 12 years and treated with ETI between September 2020 and November 2021. Clinical and laboratory data of each patient and study visit were collected before and after 24 weeks of ETI treatment. Follow-up status of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (PsA) colonization was assessed after one year of therapy by regularly determined sputum or throat swab samples.Results: Marked improvements biochemical markers of systemic inflammation as white blood cell count, levels of immunoglobulins A, G and M and albumin within 24 weeks of therapy were observed. ETI treatment proved to be effective as seen by amelioration of lung function and sweat chloride concentration. Assessment of PsA colonization status revealed a conversion from a positive to negative detection in 36% of the cases after one year of therapy.Conclusions: ETI treatment effectively improves systemic inflammation parameters and shows promising results in PsA status conversion.",37153441,PMC10160512,10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e15756,,2023,"Schnell A, Hober H, Kaiser N, Ruppel R, Geppert A, Tremel C, Sobel J, Plattner E, Woelfle J, Hoerning A.",Y,MED
Global functional genomics reveals GRK5 as a cystic fibrosis therapeutic target synergistic with current modulators.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening disease affecting >160,000 individuals worldwide predominantly with respiratory symptoms. About 80% of individuals with CF have the p.Phe508del variant that causes the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein to misfold and be targeted for premature degradation by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control (ERQC), thus preventing its plasma membrane (PM) traffic. Despite the recent approval of a ""highly effective"" drug rescuing p.Phe508del-CFTR, maximal lung function improvement is ∼14%. To identify global modulators of p.Phe508del traffic, we performed a high-content small interfering RNA (siRNA) microscopy-based screen of >9,000 genes and monitored p.Phe508del-CFTR PM rescue in human airway cells. This primary screen identified 227 p.Phe508del-CFTR traffic regulators, of which 35 could be validated by additional siRNAs. Subsequent mechanistic studies established GRK5 as a robust regulator whose inhibition rescues p.Phe508del-CFTR PM traffic and function in primary and immortalized cells, thus emerging as a novel potential drug target for CF.",40040803,PMC11876911,10.1016/j.isci.2025.111942,,2025,"Botelho HM, Lopes-Pacheco M, Pinto MC, Railean V, Pankonien I, Caleiro MF, Clarke LA, Cachatra V, Neumann B, Tischer C, Moiteiro C, Ousingsawat J, Kunzelmann K, Pepperkok R, Amaral MD.",Y,MED

Patient and Caregiver Perceptions of Airway Clearance Methods Used for Cystic Fibrosis.,"Introduction: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation guidelines recommend people with CF perform daily airway clearance. This can be difficult for patients, as some find it time consuming or uncomfortable. Data comparing airway clearance methods are limited. We surveyed patients and their families to understand which methods are preferred and identify obstacles to performing airway clearance.Methods: We designed a REDCap survey and enrolled participants in 2021. Respondents reported information on airway clearance usage, time commitment, and medication use. They rated airway clearance methods for effectiveness, comfort, time commitment, importance, and compatibility with other treatments. The analysis included descriptive statistics and clustering.Results: 60 respondents started and 52 completed the survey. The median patient age was 20 years. Respondents experienced a median of four airway clearance methods in their lifetime, including chest wall oscillation (vest, 92%), manual chest physical therapy (CPT, 88%), forced expiration technique (huff or cough, 77%), and exercise (75%). Past 30-day use was highest for exercise (62%) and vest (57%). The time commitment was generally less than 2 hours daily. Of those eligible for CFTR modulators, 53% reported decreased time commitment to airway clearance after starting treatment. On a scale of 0-100, respondents rated CFTR modulators as their most important treatment (median 99.5), followed by exercise (88). *Discussion*. Patients and caregivers are familiar with several methods of airway clearance for CF. They report distinct strengths and limitations of each method. Exercise and vest are the most common methods of airway clearance. The use of CFTR modulators may reduce patient-reported time commitment to airway clearance.",37547298,PMC10403321,10.1155/2023/1422319,,2023,"Kienenberger ZE, Farber TO, Teresi ME, Milavetz F, Singh SB, Larson Ode K, Thoma T, Weiner RL, Burlage KR, Fischer AJ.",Y,MED
Modulator Therapy in Cystic Fibrosis Patients with *cis* Variants in F508del Complex Allele: A Short-Term Observational Case Series.,"Previous studies reported the influence of *cis* variants in F508del cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in their responses to *CFTR* modulators. The current study is a prospective, observational study involving three patients with CF and pancreatic insufficiency, carrying a complex allele including F508del with A238V, I1027T, or L467F. We report clinical data before and after 4 weeks of treatment with tezacaftor (TEZ)/ivacaftor (IVA), elexacaftor (ELX)/TEZ/IVA, and lumacaftor (LUM)/IVA for patients with complex alleles A238V, I1027T, and L467F, respectively. The 50-year-old patient bearing F508del;A238V/D1152H showed a normal sweat test (13 mEq/L) and improvements in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) (+7 points), body mass index (BMI) (+0.85), and respiratory CF Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) domain (+22.2 points). The 12-year-old patient bearing F508del;I1027T/R709X showed an improvement in a sweat test (-40 mEq/l), FEV1 (+9 points) and the respiratory CFQ-R domain (+16.7 points). No changes in outcomes were observed for the 6-year-old patient F508del;L467F/F508del. Our data highlight that the reported variants do not modify the phenotypic expression of F508del. Searching L467F is crucial in CF patients with F508del nonresponsive to ELX/TEZ/IVA. Further data are needed to evaluate the clinical effect of these variants after a longer follow up.",36143206,PMC9504164,10.3390/jpm12091421,,2022,"Terlizzi V, Centrone C, Ferrari B, Castellani C, Gunawardena TNA, Taccetti G, Laselva O.",Y,MED

Modulator Combination Improves In Vitro the Microrheological Properties of the Airway Surface Liquid of Cystic Fibrosis Airway Epithelia.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a plasma membrane protein expressed on the apical surface of secretory epithelia of the airways. In the airways, defective or absent function of the CFTR protein determines abnormalities of chloride and bicarbonate secretion and, in general, of the transepithelial homeostasis that lead to alterations of airway surface liquid (ASL) composition and properties. The reduction of ASL volume impairs ciliary beating with the consequent accumulation of a sticky mucus. This situation prevents normal mucociliary clearance, favoring the survival and proliferation of bacteria and contributing to the genesis of the CF pulmonary disease. We explored the potential of some CFTR modulators, namely ivacaftor, tezacaftor, elexacaftor and their combination KaftrioTM, capable of partially recovering the basic defects of the CFTR protein, to ameliorate the transepithelial fluid transport and the viscoelastic properties of the mucus when used singly or in combination. Primary human bronchial epithelial cells obtained from CF and non-CF patients were differentiated into a mucociliated epithelia in order to assess the effects of correctors tezacaftor, elexacaftor and their combination with potentiator ivacaftor on the key properties of ASL, such as fluid reabsorption, viscosity, protein content and pH. The treatment of airway epithelia bearing the deletion of a phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del) in the CFTR gene with tezacaftor and elexacaftor significantly improved the pericilial fluid composition, reducing the fluid reabsorption, correcting the ASL pH and reducing the viscosity of the mucus. KaftrioTM was more effective than single modulators in improving all the evaluated parameters, demonstrating once more that this combination recently approved for patients 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene represents a valuable tool to defeat CF.",36232697,PMC9569604,10.3390/ijms231911396,,2022,"Ludovico A, Moran O, Baroni D.",Y,MED
Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor: A Life-Changing Triple Combination of CFTR Modulator Drugs for Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a potentially fatal monogenic disease that causes a progressive multisystemic pathology. Over the last decade, the introduction of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator drugs into clinical practice has profoundly modified the lives of many people with CF (PwCF) by targeting the fundamental cause of the disease. These drugs consist of the potentiator ivacaftor (VX-770) and the correctors lumacaftor (VX-809), tezacaftor (VX-661), and elexacaftor (VX-445). In particular, the triple combination of CFTR modulators composed of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor (ETI) represents a life-changing therapy for the majority of PwCF worldwide. A growing number of clinical studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of ETI therapy in both short- and long-term (up to two years of follow-up to date) and its ability to significantly reduce pulmonary and gastrointestinal manifestations, sweat chloride concentration, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, and infertility/subfertility, among other disease signs and symptoms. Nevertheless, ETI therapy-related adverse effects have also been reported, and close monitoring by a multidisciplinary healthcare team remains vital. This review aims to address and discuss the major therapeutic benefits and adverse effects reported by the clinical use of ETI therapy for PwCF.",36986509,PMC10053019,10.3390/ph16030410,,2023,"Bacalhau M, Camargo M, Magalhães-Ghiotto GAV, Drumond S, Castelletti CHM, Lopes-Pacheco M.",Y,MED
Effects of CFTR-modulator triple therapy on sinunasal symptoms in children and adults with cystic fibrosis.,"Purpose: Sinunasal symptoms and chronic rhinusinutitis are common in patients with cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) modulators have led to dramatic improvements of respiratory symptoms and quality of life in patients with cystic fibrosis. This study aims to evaluate subjective and objective sinunasal symptoms after start of CFTR-modulator triple therapy.Methods: 43 patients (n = 6 < 18 years), treated with highly effective CFTR-modulator therapy with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) were included, as were 20 controls with cystic fibrosis but without CFTR-modulator therapy (n = 6 < 18 years). All assessed their sinunasal symptoms retrospectively and the intervention group at a mean of 9.3 (2-16) months after start of ELX/TEZ/IVA.Results: Improvements in SNOT-22 overall score from m = 32.7 to m = 15.7 points (p < 0.0001) as well in the nasal, emotional, otologic, and sleep subdomains could be demonstrated in the intervention group. No changes were found in the control group. Children showed lower SNOT-22 scores than adults and a reduction of SNOT-22 total score from m = 9.4 to m = 2.2 (p = 0.25) was found. 8 patients were evaluated by an otorhinolaryngologist before and after start of ELX/TEZ/IVA and showed pronounced objective clinical improvement.Conclusions: Highly effective CFTR-modulator therapy has a significant positive impact on both subjective and objective sinunasal symptoms in patients with CF and some improvement could be demonstrated in children < 18 years as well.",36738326,PMC10219879,10.1007/s00405-023-07859-4,,2023,"Bode SFN, Rapp H, Lienert N, Appel H, Fabricius D.",Y,MED
Impact of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor on Healthcare Resource Utilization and Associated Costs Among People With Cystic Fibrosis in the US: A Retrospective Claims Analysis.,"Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) is a CFTR modulator (CFTRm) that targets the underlying cause of CF. Based on safety and efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials, ELX/TEZ/IVA is approved in the US for the treatment of CF in people aged ≥ 2 years who have ≥ 1 F508del-CFTR mutation or a CFTR mutation that is responsive to ELX/TEZ/IVA based on in vitro data. While ELX/TEZ/IVA demonstrated unprecedented improvements in lung function and dramatic reductions in pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) and associated hospitalizations in clinical trials, a limited number of studies have examined the impact of ELX/TEZ/IVA on healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and associated costs in a real-world setting. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate changes in PEx, HCRU, and associated non-CFTRm healthcare costs following initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA among people with CF aged ≥ 12 years in the US.Methods: We evaluated the rates of PEx, HCRU, and associated costs before and after initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA in people with CF aged ≥ 12 years using data from the Merative MarketScan® Commercial Claims and Encounters Database and the Merative Multi-State Medicaid Database from April 21, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Because the study period included time following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we limited our primary analysis to the period prior to the pandemic (October 21, 2019 to March 12, 2020). Outcomes following the onset of the pandemic (March 13 to December 31, 2020) were examined in an exploratory analysis.Results: In both commercially insured and Medicaid-insured people with CF, ELX/TEZ/IVA was associated with reductions in PEx, hospitalizations, and associated costs prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and these reductions were maintained following the onset of the pandemic.Conclusions: These findings suggest that ELX/TEZ/IVA reduces the burden and costs associated with PEx and hospitalizations in people with CF.",37874528,PMC10721580,10.1007/s41030-023-00241-z,,2023,"Schechter MS, Sabater-Anaya N, Oster G, Weycker D, Wu H, Arteaga-Solis E, Bagal S, McGarry LJ, Van Brunt K, Geiger JM.",Y,MED

Potentiation of BKCa channels by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator correctors VX-445 and VX-121.,"Cystic fibrosis results from mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel, ultimately leading to diminished transepithelial anion secretion and mucociliary clearance. CFTR correctors are therapeutics that restore the folding/trafficking of mutated CFTR to the plasma membrane. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (BKCa, KCa1.1) is also critical for maintaining lung airway surface liquid (ASL) volume. Here, we show that the class 2 (C2) CFTR corrector VX-445 (elexacaftor) induces K+ secretion across WT and F508del CFTR primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEs), which was entirely inhibited by the BKCa antagonist paxilline. Similar results were observed with VX-121, a corrector under clinical evaluation. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings verified that CFTR correctors potentiated BKCa activity from both primary HBEs and HEK cells stably expressing the α subunit (HEK-BK cells). Furthermore, excised patch-clamp recordings from HEK-BK cells verified direct action on the channel and demonstrated a significant increase in open probability. In mouse mesenteric artery, VX-445 induced a paxilline-sensitive vasorelaxation of preconstricted arteries. VX-445 also reduced firing frequency in primary rat hippocampal and cortical neurons. We raise the possibilities that C2 CFTR correctors gain additional clinical benefit by activation of BKCa in the lung yet may lead to adverse events through BKCa activation elsewhere.",38954478,PMC11324306,10.1172/jci176328,,2024,"Kolski-Andreaco A, Taiclet S, Myerburg MM, Sembrat J, Bridges RJ, Straub AC, Wills ZP, Butterworth MB, Devor DC.",Y,MED
Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor therapy has negligible effects on the cystic fibrosis gut microbiome.,"People with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) experience a range of persistent gastrointestinal symptoms throughout life. There is evidence indicating interaction between the microbiota and gut pathophysiology in CF. However, there is a paucity of knowledge on the potential effects of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies on the gut microbiome. In a pilot study, we investigated the impact of Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor dual combination CFTR modulator therapy on the gut microbiota and metabolomic functioning in pwCF. Fecal samples from 12 pwCF taken at baseline and following placebo or Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor administration were subjected to microbiota sequencing and to targeted metabolomics to assess the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) composition. Ten healthy matched controls were included as a comparison. Inflammatory calprotectin levels and patient symptoms were also investigated. No significant differences were observed in overall gut microbiota characteristics between any of the study stages, extended also across intestinal inflammation, gut symptoms, and SCFA-targeted metabolomics. However, microbiota and SCFA metabolomic compositions, in pwCF, were significantly different from controls in all study treatment stages. CFTR modulator therapy with Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor had negligible effects on both the gut microbiota and SCFA composition across the course of the study and did not alter toward compositions observed in healthy controls. Future longitudinal CFTR modulator studies will investigate more effective CFTR modulators and should use prolonged sampling periods, to determine whether longer-term changes occur in the CF gut microbiome. IMPORTANCE People with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) experience persistent gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms throughout life. The research question ""how can we relieve gastrointestinal symptoms, such as stomach pain, bloating, and nausea?"" remains a top priority for clinical research in CF. While CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies are understood to correct underlying issues of CF disease and increasing the numbers of pwCF are now receiving some form of CFTR modulator treatment. It is not known how these therapies affect the gut microbiome or GI system. In this pilot study, we investigated, for the first time, effects of the dual combination CFTR modulator medicine, Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor. We found it had negligible effects on patient GI symptoms, intestinal inflammation, or gut microbiome composition and functioning. Our findings are important as they fill important knowledge gaps on the relative effectiveness of these widely used treatments. We are now investigating triple combination CFTR modulators with prolonged sampling periods.",37607068,PMC10581179,10.1128/spectrum.01175-23,,2023,"Marsh R, Dos Santos C, Hanson L, Ng C, Major G, Smyth AR, Rivett D, van der Gast C.",Y,MED
"Impact of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor on lung function, nutritional status, pulmonary exacerbation frequency and sweat chloride in people with cystic fibrosis: real-world evidence from the German CF Registry.","Background: Treatment with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) improves multiple clinical outcomes in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) with at least one F508del allele. This study evaluated the real-world impact of ETI on lung function, nutritional status, pulmonary exacerbation frequency, and sweat chloride concentrations in a large group of pwCF.Methods: This observational cohort study used data from the German CF Registry for pwCF who received ETI therapy and were followed up for a period of 12 months.Findings: The study included 2645 pwCF from 67 centres in Germany (mean age 28.0 ± 11.5 years). Over the first year after ETI was initiated, percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV1) increased by 11.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.8-11.8, p < 0.0001), body mass index (BMI) *z*-score increased by 0.3 (95% CI 0.3-0.4, p < 0.0001) in individuals aged 12 to <18 years and BMI in adults increased by 1.4 kg/m2 (95% CI 1.3-1.4, p < 0.0001), pulmonary exacerbations decreased by 75.9% (p < 0.0001) and mean sweat chloride concentration decreased by 50.9 mmol/L (95% CI -52.6, -49.3, p < 0.0001). Improvements in ppFEV1 over the first year of therapy were greater in pwCF who had not previously received cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy (12.6% [95% CI 11.9-13.4] vs. 9.7% [95% CI 9.0-10.5] in those with prior CFTR modulator treatment.Interpretation: These real-world data are consistent with the findings of randomised clinical trials, and support the use of ETI as a highly effective treatment option for pwCF who have at least one F508del allele.Funding: None.",37554663,PMC10405057,10.1016/j.lanepe.2023.100690,,2023,"Sutharsan S, Dillenhoefer S, Welsner M, Stehling F, Brinkmann F, Burkhart M, Ellemunter H, Dittrich AM, Smaczny C, Eickmeier O, Kappler M, Schwarz C, Sieber S, Naehrig S, Naehrlich L, German CF Registry of the Mukoviszidose e.V. and participating CF sites.",Y,MED
Anti-Inflammatory Influences of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Drugs on Lung Inflammation in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) which instigates a myriad of respiratory complications including increased vulnerability to lung infections and lung inflammation. The extensive influx of pro-inflammatory cells and production of mediators into the CF lung leading to lung tissue damage and increased susceptibility to microbial infections, creates a highly inflammatory environment. The CF inflammation is particularly driven by neutrophil infiltration, through the IL-23/17 pathway, and function, through NE, NETosis, and NLRP3-inflammasome formation. Better understanding of these pathways may uncover untapped therapeutic targets, potentially reducing disease burden experienced by CF patients. This review outlines the dysregulated lung inflammatory response in CF, explores the current understanding of CFTR modulators on lung inflammation, and provides context for their potential use as therapeutics for CF. Finally, we discuss the determinants that need to be taken into consideration to understand the exaggerated inflammatory response in the CF lung.",34299226,PMC8306345,10.3390/ijms22147606,,2021,"Harwood KH, McQuade RM, Jarnicki A, Schneider-Futschik EK.",Y,MED
Revisiting the Role of Leukocytes in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis in characterized by pulmonary bacterial colonization and hyperinflammation. Lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells of patients with CF express functional CFTR and are directly affected by altered CFTR expression/function, impairing their ability to resolve infections and inflammation. However, the mechanism behind and the contribution of leukocytes in the pathogenesis of CF are still poorly characterized. The recent clinical introduction of specific CFTR modulators added an important tool not only for the clinical management of the disease but also to the investigation of the pathophysiological mechanisms related to CFTR dysfunction and dysregulated immunity. These drugs treat the basic defect in cystic fibrosis (CF) by increasing CFTR function with improvement of lung function and quality of life, and may improve clinical outcomes also by correcting the dysregulated immune function that characterizes CF. Measure of CFTR function, protein expression profiling and several omics methods were used to identify molecular changes in freshly isolated leukocytes of CF patients, highlighting two roles of leukocytes in CF: one more generally related to the mechanism(s) causing immune dysregulation in CF and unresolved inflammation, and another more applicative role, which identifies in myeloid cells, an important tool predictive of the therapeutic response of CF patients. In this review we will summarize available data on CFTR expression and function in leukocyte populations and will discuss potential clinical applications based on available data.",34943888,PMC8699441,10.3390/cells10123380,,2021,"Averna M, Melotti P, Sorio C.",Y,MED

Combined CFTR modulator therapies are linked with anabolic benefits and insulin-sparing in cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.,"Aims: Combined CFTR modulator therapies have dramatically altered pulmonary outcomes in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Their impact on glucose metabolism requires further investigations. This study aims to evaluate insulin requirements after initiation of combined CFTR modulator therapy in patients with CF-related diabetes (CFRD) and HOMA indices changes in CF patients without diabetes.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed: 1) the effects of tezacaftor + ivacaftor and elexacaftor + tezacaftor + ivacaftor on FEV1, weight, BMI, HbA1c, and daily insulin dose, in 17 CFRD patients and 2) the impact of tezacaftor + ivacaftor on HOMA indices in 15 CF patients without diabetes.Results: Age was 37±12y in the CFRD group (70% men), 88% of whom were homozygous for F508del mutation. Diabetes duration was 15±10y. Median duration of combined CFTR modulator therapy was 16 months (IQR: 4) Thirteen patients received tezacaftor + ivacaftor, of whom 9 were switched to elexacaftor + tezacaftor + ivacaftor. Four patients received elexacaftor + tezacaftor + ivacaftor up front. A decrease in insulin needs was noticed in 88% of patients (0.85±0.3 *vs* 0.71±0.3U/kg/day; *p = 0001*). Total daily insulin dose decreased from 50±16 to 44±20U/day (*p = 0.017*). BMI improved (20.9 (IQR: 1.90) *vs* 22.1 kg/m2 (IQR: 3.70); *p = 0.014*). HbA1c went from 7.3±1.1 to 7.7±1.6% (*p = 0.072*). Median age was 22y (IQR: 11) in the CF group without diabetes (67% men), 93% of whom were homozygous for F508del mutation. Duration of combined CFTR modulator therapy was 10±5 months. HOMA-B changes were not significant (129.2 (IQR: 84.8) *vs* 103.5% (IQR: 66.3) nor were HOMA-S changes (from 94±64 to 95±49%). HOMA-BxS decreased from 112±45 to 104±29% (NS). BMI rose from 21.9±3 to 23.1±3.5 kg/m2 (*p = 0.047*). HbA1c was unchanged (5.0±0.5%). FEV1 improved in both groups (+11% and + 7% of predicted value; *p < 0.001*; *p = 0.013*).Conclusion: Combined CFTR modulator therapies are correlated with a decrease in insulin doses and positive effects on BMI and FEV1.

Survival of people with cystic fibrosis in Australia.,"Survival statistics, estimated using data from national cystic fibrosis (CF) registries, inform the CF community and monitor disease progression. This study aimed to estimate survival among people with CF in Australia and to identify factors associated with survival. This population-based cohort study used prospectively collected data from 23 Australian CF centres participating in the Australian CF Data Registry (ACFDR) from 2005-2020. Period survival analysis was used to calculate median age of survival estimates for each 5-year window from 2005-2009 until 2016-2020. The overall median survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Between 2005-2020 the ACFDR followed 4,601 people with CF, noting 516 (11.2%) deaths including 195 following lung transplantation. Out of the total sample, more than half (52.5%) were male and 395 (8.6%) had undergone lung transplantation. Two thirds of people with CF (66.1%) were diagnosed before six weeks of age or by newborn/prenatal screening. The overall median age of survival was estimated as 54.0 years (95% CI: 51.0-57.04). Estimated median survival increased from 48.9 years (95% CI: 44.7-53.5) for people with CF born in 2005-2009, to 56.3 years (95% CI: 51.2-60.4) for those born in 2016-2020. Factors independently associated with reduced survival include receiving a lung transplant, having low FEV1pp and BMI. Median survival estimates are increasing in CF in Australia. This likely reflects multiple factors, including newborn screening, improvement in diagnosis, refinements in CF management and centre-based multidisciplinary care.",36396972,PMC9672093,10.1038/s41598-022-24374-4,,2022,"Ruseckaite R, Salimi F, Earnest A, Bell SC, Douglas T, Frayman K, Keatley L, King S, Kotsimbos T, Middleton PG, Morey S, Mulrennan S, Schultz A, Wainwright C, Ward N, Wark P, Ahern S.",Y,MED
Translational Research in Cystic Fibrosis: From Bench to Beside.,"Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-limiting recessive genetic disorder in Caucasian populations, characterized by the involvement of exocrine glands, causing multisystemic comorbidities. Since the first descriptions of pancreatic and pulmonary involvement in children, technological development and basic science research have allowed great advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis. The great search for treatments that acted at the genetic level, despite not having found a cure for this disease, culminated in the creation of CFTR modulators, highly effective medications for certain groups of patients. However, there are still many obstacles behind the treatment of the disease to be discussed, given the wide variety of mutations and phenotypes involved and the difficulty of access that permeate these new therapies around the world.",35652053,PMC9149599,10.3389/fped.2022.881470,,2022,"Garcia LCE, Petry LM, Germani PAVS, Xavier LF, de Barros PB, Meneses ADS, Prestes LM, Bittencourt LB, Pieta MP, Friedrich F, Pinto LA.",Y,MED
Forskolin-induced organoid swelling is associated with long-term cystic fibrosis disease progression.,"Rationale: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic life-shortening disease associated with highly variable individual disease progression which is difficult to predict. Here we assessed the association of forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) of patient-derived organoids with long-term CF disease progression in multiple organs and compared FIS with the golden standard biomarker sweat chloride concentration (SCC).Methods: We retrieved 9-year longitudinal clinical data from the Dutch CF Registry of 173 people with mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene. Individual CFTR function was defined by FIS, measured as the relative size increase of intestinal organoids after stimulation with 0.8 µM forskolin, quantified as area under the curve (AUC). We used linear mixed-effect models and multivariable logistic regression to estimate the association of FIS with long-term forced expiratory volume in 1 s % predicted (FEV1pp) decline and development of pancreatic insufficiency, CF-related liver disease and diabetes. Within these models, FIS was compared with SCC.Results: FIS was strongly associated with longitudinal changes of lung function, with an estimated difference in annual FEV1pp decline of 0.32% (95% CI 0.11-0.54%; p=0.004) per 1000-point change in AUC. Moreover, increasing FIS levels were associated with lower odds of developing pancreatic insufficiency (adjusted OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.46; p<0.001), CF-related liver disease (adjusted OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06-0.54; p=0.002) and diabetes (adjusted OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12-0.97; p=0.044). These associations were absent for SCC.Conclusion: This study exemplifies the prognostic value of a patient-derived organoid-based biomarker within a clinical setting, which is especially important for people carrying rare *CFTR* mutations with unclear clinical consequences.",35086832,PMC9386333,10.1183/13993003.00508-2021,,2022,"Muilwijk D, de Poel E, van Mourik P, Suen SWF, Vonk AM, Brunsveld JE, Kruisselbrink E, Oppelaar H, Hagemeijer MC, Berkers G, de Winter-de Groot KM, Heida-Michel S, Jans SR, van Panhuis H, van der Eerden MM, van der Meer R, Roukema J, Dompeling E, Weersink EJM, Koppelman GH, Vries R, Zomer-van Ommen DD, Eijkemans MJC, van der Ent CK, Beekman JM.",Y,MED
"Cystic fibrosis screening, evaluation, and management of hepatobiliary disease consensus recommendations.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) may cause a spectrum of hepatobiliary complications, including portal hypertension, multilobular cirrhosis, and liver failure. Current guidelines on the detection and monitoring of hepatobiliary complications in CF were published in 1999. The CF Foundation assembled a committee to evaluate research advances and formulate revised guidelines for CF-associated liver disease. A committee of hepatologists, gastroenterologists, pulmonologists, pharmacists, nurses, dietitians, individuals with CF, and the parents of a child with CF devised ""population, intervention, comparison, and outcome"" questions regarding hepatobiliary disease in CF. PubMed literature searches were performed for each population, intervention, comparison, and outcome question. Recommendations were voted on with 80% agreement required to approve a recommendation. Public comment on initial recommendations was solicited prior to the formulation of final recommendations. Thirty-one population, intervention, comparison, and outcome questions were assembled, 6401 manuscripts were title screened for relevance, with 1053 manuscripts undergoing detailed full-text review. Seven recommendations were approved for screening, 13 for monitoring of existing disease, and 14 for treatment of CF-associated hepatobiliary involvement or advanced liver disease. One recommendation on liver biopsy did not meet the 80% threshold. One recommendation on screening ultrasound was revised and re-voted on. Through a multidisciplinary committee and public engagement, we have assembled updated recommendations and guidance on screening, monitoring, and treatment of CF-associated hepatobiliary involvement and advanced liver disease.

State of the Art on Approved Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (*CFTR*) Modulators and Triple-Combination Therapy.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting inherited disease in Caucasian populations, affecting approximately 80,000 people worldwide. CF is a complex multi-organ monogenic autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene. Since the discovery of the *CFTR* gene in 1989, more than 2000 mutations have been identified so far and about 240 can cause CF. Until recently, the treatment for CF was aimed to prevent and manage the manifestations of *CFTR* dysfunction, primarily recurrent pulmonary infections and pancreatic exocrine failure. Over the past few decades, the therapeutic approach to CF has been revolutionized by the development of a new class of small molecules called *CFTR* modulators that target specific defects caused by mutations in the *CFTR* gene. *CFTR* modulators have been shown to change profoundly the clinical course of the CF, leading to meaningful improvements in the lives of a large proportion of people of CF heterozygous for F508del, especially if started in young children. Further studies are needed to extend the use of triple *CFTR* modulation therapy also for young children in order to prevent the irreversible effects of the disease and for patients with very rare mutations with a personalized approach to treatment.",34577628,PMC8471029,10.3390/ph14090928,,2021,"Meoli A, Fainardi V, Deolmi M, Chiopris G, Marinelli F, Caminiti C, Esposito S, Pisi G.",Y,MED
Lived experiences of individuals with cystic fibrosis on CFTR-modulators.,"Background: CFTR-modulators are a category of drugs that facilitate trafficking and opening of the abnormal CFTR protein in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have certain genetic mutations. Clinical trial data show that individuals taking CFTR-modulators have increased or stable lung function (FEV1) as well as reduced frequency of pulmonary exacerbations. There are no data on whether CFTR-modulators influence psychosocial aspects of the lives of individuals with CF. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how the introduction of CFTR-modulators has affected individuals' lived experiences outside of clinical health variables; that is, to explore whether there is a relationship between using CFTR-modulator drugs and the psychological and social aspects of the lives of individuals with CF, including: career, relationships, family planning and psychological functioning.Methods: Eight men and women with CF ages 24-32, with a history of taking any approved CFTR-modulator for at least six months, were recruited from an adult CF center. A semi-structured interview guide was used to interview the participants. The data were coded using a grounded theory approach with an iterative methodology.Results: Four themes emerged from the data: stability, identity, potentiality, and hope.Conclusions: Although these themes cannot be generalized to all individuals with CF, this study provides preliminary data for how CFTR-modulators may influence an individual with CF's outlook on life and that these individuals are feeling hopeful about the future.",35062937,PMC8781590,10.1186/s12890-022-01825-2,,2022,"Page A, Goldenberg A, Matthews AL.",Y,MED
Cystic Fibrosis and Oxidative Stress: The Role of CFTR.,"There is substantial evidence in the literature that patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have higher oxidative stress than patients with other diseases or healthy subjects. This results in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in a deficit of antioxidant molecules and plays a fundamental role in the progression of chronic lung damage. Although it is known that recurrent infection-inflammation cycles in CF patients generate a highly oxidative environment, numerous clinical and preclinical studies suggest that the airways of a patient with CF present an inherently abnormal proinflammatory milieu due to elevated oxidative stress and abnormal lipid metabolism even before they become infected. This could be directly related to cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) deficiency, which appears to produce a redox imbalance in epithelial cells and extracellular fluids. This review aims to summarize the main mechanism by which CFTR deficiency is intrinsically responsible for the proinflammatory environment that characterizes the lung of a patient with CF.",36014562,PMC9413234,10.3390/molecules27165324,,2022,"Moliteo E, Sciacca M, Palmeri A, Papale M, Manti S, Parisi GF, Leonardi S.",Y,MED
Future Comorbidities in an Aging Cystic Fibrosis Population.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease due to mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. With the advent of highly effective modulator therapy targeting the abnormal CFTR protein, people with CF (PwCF) are living more than 40 years longer than the pre-modulator therapy era. As a result, PwCF are facing new challenges of managing similar comorbidities affecting the average aging population. While CF is notoriously identified as a chronic respiratory disease, the multisystem presence of the CFTR gene can contribute to other organ-related complications acutely, but also heighten the likelihood of chronic conditions not routinely encountered in this cohort. In this overview, we will focus on risk factors and epidemiology for PwCF as they relate to cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, CF-related diabetes, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, CF-liver disease, bone health and malignancy. With increased awareness of diseases affecting a newly aging CF population, a focus on primary and secondary prevention will be imperative to implementing a comprehensive care plan to improve long-term morbidity and mortality.",37374088,PMC10301499,10.3390/life13061305,,2023,"Ticona JH, Lapinel N, Wang J.",Y,MED
Impact of *CFTR* Modulators on the Impaired Function of Phagocytes in Cystic Fibrosis Lung Disease.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common genetically inherited disease in Caucasian populations, is a multi-systemic life-threatening autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene. In 2012, the arrival of *CFTR* modulators (potentiators, correctors, amplifiers, stabilizers, and read-through agents) revolutionized the therapeutic approach to CF. In this review, we examined the physiopathological mechanism of chronic dysregulated innate immune response in the lungs of CF patients with pulmonary involvement with particular reference to phagocytes, critically analyzing the role of *CFTR* modulators in influencing and eventually restoring their function. Our literature review highlighted that the role of *CFTR* in the lungs is crucial not only for the epithelial function but also for host defense, with particular reference to phagocytes. In macrophages and neutrophils, the *CFTR* dysfunction compromises both the intricate process of phagocytosis and the mechanisms of initiation and control of inflammation which then reverberates on the epithelial environment already burdened by the chronic colonization of pathogens leading to irreversible tissue damage. In this context, investigating the impact of *CFTR* modulators on phagocytic functions is therefore crucial not only for explaining the underlying mechanisms of pleiotropic effects of these molecules but also to better understand the physiopathological basis of this disease, still partly unexplored, and to develop new complementary or alternative therapeutic approaches.",36293274,PMC9604330,10.3390/ijms232012421,,2022,"Meoli A, Eickmeier O, Pisi G, Fainardi V, Zielen S, Esposito S.",Y,MED
Body composition in individuals with cystic fibrosis.,"Because nutritional status is intimately linked with pulmonary function and survival, nutrition has been at the mainstay of cystic fibrosis (CF) care. Body Mass Index (BMI) is traditionally used to define nutritional status because of the ease with which it can be calculated, but it has a number of limitations including its inability to differentiate fat mass (FM) from lean body mass (LBM), the latter thought to confer health advantage. A number of tools are available to quantify body composition including dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), bioelectrical impedance, MRI, CT, air displacement plethysmography, and stable isotopes, and these have been used to varying degrees in studies of CF. In CF, LBM tends to be lower for a given BMI, particularly at lower BMI. In adults, lower fat-free mass (FFM) correlates with greater CF disease severity, lower pulmonary function and higher inflammatory markers. FFM is also positively associated with greater bone mineral density, while greater FM is associated with greater loss of lumbar spine bone mineral density over 2 years. In youth, LBM is positively associated with pulmonary function. The predictive value of body composition for functional and clinical outcomes and the role of improving LBM on these outcomes remain undefined. With improvements in BMI accompanying highly-effective modulator therapy, closer evaluations of body composition may inform risk for more traditional, non-CF adult outcomes in CF.",34804808,PMC8586800,10.1016/j.jcte.2021.100272,,2021,"Soltman S, Hicks RA, Naz Khan F, Kelly A.",Y,MED

The increasing incidence of tumors includes also breast cancer. The risk of breast cancer is higher in CF patients compared to the general population. Sex hormones, especially estrogens, also affect on the pathophysiology and immunology of the CF. Previous research, has demonstrated unequivocal survival rates for female CF patients compared to their male counterparts. Is demonstrated, that chemotherapy used for breast cancer affects the CFTR channel and CFTR modulator therapy has frequent side effects on breast tissue.

We report the experience of two CF centers in which LCI monitoring was used to evaluate the efficacy of DNase therapy.Methods: This is a prospective and observational study, evaluating the effects of DNase therapy on LCI values in three CF children followed at CF centers in Florence and Catania, Italy. In both centers, LCI was performed routinely, every 3-6 months, based on the clinical picture and severity of the lung disease. In this study, we evaluated the LCI before and after long-term DNase therapy.Results: DNase improved LCI values in the absence of respiratory exacerbations: in case n. 1 LCI decreased by 39% in 16 months (from 11.1 to 6.8); in case n. 2 by 20% in 12 months (from 9.3 to 7.4); in case n. 3 by 24% in 16 months (from 9.3 to 7.0).Conclusions: This case series confirms the efficacy of DNase therapy in CF children, as demonstrated by the LCI reduction in treated patients. Furthermore, our results suggest that LCI is a sensitive marker of disease and can be used for the evaluation of response to treatment.",36360353,PMC9688561,10.3390/children9111625,,2022,"Terlizzi V, Parisi GF, Ferrari B, Castellani C, Manti S, Leonardi S, Taccetti G.",Y,MED

Regulatory T cell enhancement in adults with cystic fibrosis receiving Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor therapy.,"Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF), especially CF lung disease, is characterized by chronic infection, immune dysfunction including impairment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and an exaggerated inflammatory response. CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators have shown to improve clinical outcomes in people with CF (PwCF) with a wide range of CFTR mutations. However, it remains unclear whether CFTR modulator therapy also affects CF-associated inflammation. We aimed to examine the effect of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor therapy on lymphocyte subsets and systemic cytokines in PwCF.Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma were collected before and at three and six months after the initiation of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor therapy; lymphocyte subsets and systemic cytokines were determined using flow cytometry.Results: Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor treatment was initiated in 77 PwCF and improved percent predicted FEV1 by 12.5 points (p<0.001) at 3 months. During elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor therapy, percentages of Tregs were enhanced (+18.7%, p<0.001), with an increased proportion of Tregs expressing CD39 as a marker of stability (+14.4%, p<0.001). Treg enhancement was more pronounced in PwCF clearing Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Only minor, non-significant shifts were observed among Th1-, Th2- and Th17-expressing effector T helper cells. These results were stable at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Cytokine measurements showed a significant decrease in interleukin-6 levels during treatment with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (-50.2%, p<0.001).Conclusion: Treatment with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor was associated with an increased percentage of Tregs, especially in PwCF clearing Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.

Evaluating FEV1 decline in diagnosis and management of pulmonary exacerbations in children with cystic fibrosis.,"Rationale: Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) decline (ΔFEV1) is associated with pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) diagnosis in cystic fibrosis (CF). Spirometry may not be available during telehealth visits and could impair clinician ability to diagnose PEx. This study aims to (1) identify the associations between degrees of ΔFEV1 (decrease of <5% predicted vs. 5%-9% predicted vs. ≥10% predicted from baseline), clinical symptoms, and clinician-diagnosed PEx and (2) evaluate the correlation between respiratory symptoms, ΔFEV1, and antibiotic treatment.Methods: Retrospective, descriptive study of PEx diagnosis and management in 628 outpatient clinical encounters with spirometry in 178 patients with CF ages 6-17 years at Riley Hospital for Children during 2019. Odds ratios (OR) of symptoms associated with clinician-defined PEx diagnosis and antibiotic management stratified by ΔFEV1 decline were determined.Results: Clinician-diagnosed PEx occurred at 199 (31.7%) visits; increased cough (77.4%) and sputum/wet cough (57.8%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Compared to no ΔFEV1, the odds of a clinician-diagnosed PEx were increased when ΔFEV15%-9% and ΔFEV1≥10% was present with increased cough (OR 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-1.94 and OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.52-2.19, respectively), increased sputum (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.20-2.12 and OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.37-2.32, respectively), and increased cough and sputum together (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.08-2.13 and OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.22-2.31, respectively).Conclusions: ΔFEV1 is associated with increased likelihood that cough and sputum are diagnosed as a PEx.

Changes in Sleep in Children and Adults with Cystic Fibrosis and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia over Time and after CFTR Modulator Therapy.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) are associated with sleep disturbances affecting quality of life (QOL) in both children and adults. However, little is known about the progression of these complaints over time, and the effect of CFTR modulator (CFTRm) therapies. Participants completed sleep quality (SDSC, PSQI) and quality of life questionnaires (PedQL, QOL-BE) as well as the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) at baseline and after 4 years. Medical records were reviewed for clinical data and correlations were sought between sleep, QOL, and clinical parameters. A total of 67 patients (33 pediatric), 37 pancreatic insufficient CF (CF-PI), 15 pancreatic sufficient CF (CF-PS), and 15 PCD patients, completed the study. In adults, global sleep quality decreased from 85.8% (76.2-90.5) to 80.9% (71.4-85.7); (*p* = 0.009). Analysis by disease cohort showed a significant deterioration only in the CF-PS group. In adults off CFTRm, sleep quality decreased from 85.7% (78.6-88.2) to 80.9% (71.4-87.3); (*p* = 0.021) and from 85.8% (76.2-92.9) to 76.2% (71.4-85.8); (*p* = 0.078) in people on CFTRm. Changes in sleep quality and changes in QOL over time were strongly associated with each other. In conclusion sleep quality deteriorates over time, correlates with QOL, and is driven primarily by adults and CF-PS patients. CFTRm has a possible effect on sleep initiation; however, results are mixed, and further long-term studies are required.",38137681,PMC10744013,10.3390/jcm12247612,,2023,"Cohen-Cymberknoh M, Lehavi M, Gileles-Hillel A, Atia O, Breuer O, Reiter J.",Y,MED
Management of pregnancy in cystic fibrosis.,"With recent therapeutic advances in care, people with cystic fibrosis (CF) are living longer and healthier lives. Development of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies has led to improved function of the CFTR protein resulting in improved lung function, decreased rates of pulmonary exacerbations and improved nutritional status for the majority of people with CF. Given improved quality and quantity of life, more people with CF are considering becoming pregnant than ever before. Since the first reported pregnancy in a woman with CF in 1960, the management of pregnancy in CF has been of increased interest and is an active field of research. In this review, we aim to discuss the management of pregnancy in CF. We discuss the optimisation of preconception health, management of maintenance CF therapies, and use of CFTR modulators during pregnancy and lactation. We also describe the management of pulmonary exacerbations during pregnancy as well as the unique management of pregnancy in a post-transplant patient with CF.Educational aims: To describe considerations for optimisation of preconception health.To describe the management of chronic CF therapies including CFTR modulators during pregnancy and lactation.To describe treatment of an acute pulmonary exacerbation during pregnancy.To describe the management of pregnancy in individuals with CF following organ transplantation.",36337124,PMC9584571,10.1183/20734735.0005-2022,,2022,"Montemayor K, Tullis E, Jain R, Taylor-Cousar JL.",Y,MED

Development and validation of a novel personalized electronic patient-reported outcome measure to assess quality of life (Q-LIFE): a prospective observational study in people with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Background: Generic and disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) may lack relevance and sensitivity on a patient-level in chronic diseases with differential disease expression and high individual variability, such as Cystic Fibrosis (CF). This study aimed to develop and validate a novel personalized electronic PROM (ePROM) that captures relevant aspects of quality of life in individuals with CF.Methods: The Q-Life app was developed as a short personalized ePROM to assess individual quality of life. Psychometric properties were assessed in a single-center cross-sectional study between September 2019 and September 2021 and in a prospective cohort study between September 2021 and September 2022.Findings: Combined studies included 223 participants (median age: 24 years, IQR: 19.0-32.5 years, range: 12.0-58.0 years). Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.83-0.90) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.65-0.92; p < 0.001) of quality of life (Q-Life) scores were strong. Q-Life scores were associated with overall Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) scores (ρ = 0.71; p < 0.001), CFQ-R respiratory domain scores (ρ = 0.57; p < 0.001) and forced expiratory volume in 1s (ρ = 0.41; p < 0.001). Furthermore, Q-Life scores improved from 65.0 (IQR: 45.0-63.3) at baseline to 84.2 (IQR: 75.0-95.0) and 87.5 (IQR: 75.0-100.0) after 3 and 6 months of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor treatment (change: 20.8; 95% CI: 17.5-25.0; p < 0.001), comparable to CFQ-R respiratory domain scores (change: 22.2, 95% CI: 19.4-25.0, p < 0.001).Interpretation: The Q-Life app is a reliable, valid and sensitive personalized ePROM to measure all aspects of quality of life that really matter to individuals with Cystic Fibrosis.

Progress in precision medicine in cystic fibrosis: a focus on CFTR modulator therapy.,"The genetic multisystem condition cystic fibrosis (CF) has seen a paradigm shift in therapeutic approaches within the past decade. Since the first clinical descriptions in the 1930s, treatment advances had focused on the downstream consequences of a dysfunctional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride ion channel. The discovery of the gene that codes for CFTR and an understanding of the way in which different genetic mutations lead to disruption of normal CFTR function have led to the creation and subsequent licensing of drugs that target this process. This marks an important move towards precision medicine in CF and results from clinical trials and real-world clinical practice have been impressive. In this review we outline how CFTR modulator drugs restore function to the CFTR protein and the progress that is being made in this field. We also describe the real-world impact of CFTR modulators on both pulmonary and multisystem complications of CF and what this will mean for the future of CF care.",35035569,PMC8753614,10.1183/20734735.0112-2021,,2021,"Tewkesbury DH, Robey RC, Barry PJ.",Y,MED
Impact of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor Therapy on the Cystic Fibrosis Airway Microbial Metagenome.,"The introduction of mutation-specific combination therapy with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) has substantially improved lung function and quality of life of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Collecting deep cough swabs and induced sputum, this postapproval study examined the effect of 14- and 50-week treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA on the airway microbial metagenome of pancreatic- insufficient CF patients aged 12 years and older. Compared to pretreatment, the total bacterial load decreased, the individual species were more evenly distributed in the community, and the individual microbial metagenomes became more similar in their composition. However, the microbial network remained vulnerable to fragmentation. The initial shift of the CF metagenome was attributable to the ELX/TEZ/IVA-mediated gain of CFTR activity followed by a diversification driven by a group of commensals at the 1-year time point that are typical for healthy airways. **IMPORTANCE** Shotgun metagenome sequencing of respiratory secretions with spike-in controls for normalization demonstrated that 1 year of high-efficient CFTR modulation with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor extensively reduced the bacterial load. Longer observation periods will be necessary to resolve whether the partial reversion of the basic defect that is achieved with ELX/TEZ/IVA is sufficient in the long run to render the CF lungs robust against the recolonization with common opportunistic pathogens.",36154176,PMC9602284,10.1128/spectrum.01454-22,,2022,"Pallenberg ST, Pust MM, Rosenboom I, Hansen G, Wiehlmann L, Dittrich AM, Tümmler B.",Y,MED

Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) prognosis.,"Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) occurs in at least 40-50% of adults with CF. With other forms of diabetes, microvascular and macrovascular disease are the major causes of morbidity and mortality. Macrovascular disease is rare in CF. While microvascular disease does occur in this population, there are CF-specific diabetes complications that have a more important impact on prognosis. The additional diagnosis of diabetes in CF is associated with decreased lung function, poor nutritional status, and an overall increase in mortality from lung disease. These negative findings start even before the clinical diagnosis of CFRD, during the period when patients experience abnormal glucose tolerance related to insulin insufficiency. The main mechanisms by which CFRD negatively affects prognosis are thought to be a combination of 1) protein catabolism, decreased lean body mass and undernutrition resulting from insulin insufficiency, and 2) an increased pro-inflammatory and pro-infectious state related to intermittent hyperglycemia. With the introduction of CFTR modulators, the care of CF patients has been revolutionized and many aspects of CF health such as BMI and lung function are improving. The impact of these drugs on the adverse prognosis related to the diagnosis of diabetes in CF, as well as the potential to delay or prevent onset of CFRD remain to be determined.",34926166,PMC8652010,10.1016/j.jcte.2021.100278,,2021,"Sandouk Z, Khan F, Khare S, Moran A.",Y,MED
Prevalence and Risk Factors for Low Bone Mineral Density in Adults With Cystic Fibrosis.,"Single-center studies have suggested that up to 70% of adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) have lower than expected bone mineral density (BMD), substantially higher than the 25% prevalence reported from national registries. We determined the prevalence of low BMD in CF adults at our center and assessed risk factors for low BMD. This retrospective cohort study was conducted in all CF patients ≥18 years of age who had a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan performed at the Johns Hopkins Adult Cystic Fibrosis center between 2010 and 2018. Prevalence and incidence of low BMD during the study period were determined. Poisson regression based on generalized estimating equations and robust standard errors were used to evaluate selected risk factors and risk of disease progression. A total of 234 individuals underwent an initial DXA scan. At this scan, prevalence of low BMD was 52.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 46.0-59.1). A total of 43.6% were at risk for CF-related low BMD (AR-CFLBMD) (95% CI 37.1-50.2) and 9.0% had CF-related low BMD (CFRLBMD) (95% CI 5.6-13.4). Of the 25 with normal BMD at initial scan and a subsequent follow-up scan, 8 (32.0%) progressed to AR-CFLBMD. Of the 53 with AR-CFLBMD on initial scan and a subsequent scan, 6 (11.3%) progressed to CFLBMD, 9 (17.0%) returned to normal BMD, and 38 (71.7%) remained AR-CFLBMD. Older age (relative risk [RR] = 1.01; 95% CI 1.00-1.01) and male sex (RR = 1.32; 95% CI 1.04-1.66) were associated with increased risk of low BMD, while higher forced expiratory volume over 1 second (FEV1%) predicted (RR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.99-1.00) and body mass index (BMI; RR = 0.97; 95% CI 0.94-1.00) were associated with lower risk for low BMD. The fact that more than half of all individuals were found to have lower than expected BMD suggests that the actual prevalence may be higher than currently reported in national registries. This supports the importance of universal bone health screening of all CF adults. © 2022 The Authors. *JBMR Plus* published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",36398108,PMC9664525,10.1002/jbm4.10666,,2022,"Boyle RL, Psoter KJ, Merlo CA, Sidhaye AR, Lechtzin N, Patel S, Montemayor K, Horne A, West NE.",Y,MED

"Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Ivacaftor, Lumacaftor, Tezacaftor, and Elexacaftor in Cystic Fibrosis: Where Are We Now?","Drugs modulating the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, namely ivacaftor, lumacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor, are currently revolutionizing the management of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), particularly those with at least one *F508del* variant (up to 85% of patients). These ""caftor"" drugs are mainly metabolized by cytochromes P450 3A, whose enzymatic activity is influenced by environmental factors, and are sensitive to inhibition and induction. Hence, CFTR modulators are characterized by an important interindividual pharmacokinetic variability and are also prone to drug-drug interactions. However, these CFTR modulators are given at standardized dosages, while they meet all criteria for a formal therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) program that should be considered in cases of clinical toxicity, less-than-expected clinical response, drug or food interactions, distinct patient subgroups (i.e., pediatrics), and for monitoring short-term adherence. While the information on CFTR drug exposure-clinical response relationships is still limited, we review the current evidence of the potential interest in the TDM of caftor drugs in real-life settings.",36015300,PMC9412421,10.3390/pharmaceutics14081674,,2022,"Choong E, Sauty A, Koutsokera A, Blanchon S, André P, Decosterd L.",Y,MED
The CFTR Amplifier Nesolicaftor Rescues TGF-β1 Inhibition of Modulator-Corrected F508del CFTR Function.,"Highly effective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators have led to dramatic improvements in lung function in many people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF). However, the efficacy of CFTR modulators may be hindered by persistent airway inflammation. The cytokine transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) is associated with worse pulmonary disease in PwCF and can diminish modulator efficacy. Thus, strategies to augment the CFTR response to modulators in an inflammatory environment are needed. Here, we tested whether the CFTR amplifier nesolicaftor (or PTI-428) could rescue the effects of TGF-β1 on CFTR function and ciliary beating in primary human CF bronchial epithelial (CFBE) cells. CFBE cells homozygous for F508del were treated with the combination of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) and TGF-β1 in the presence and absence of nesolicaftor. Nesolicaftor augmented the F508del CFTR response to ETI and reversed TGF-β1-induced reductions in CFTR conductance by increasing the expression of *CFTR* mRNA. Nesolicaftor further rescued the reduced ciliary beating and increased expression of the cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 caused by TGF-β1. Finally, nesolicaftor augmented the F508del CFTR response to ETI in CFBE cells overexpressing *miR-145*, a negative regulator of CFTR expression. Thus, CFTR amplifiers, but only when used with highly effective modulators, may provide benefit in an inflamed environment.",36142862,PMC9504033,10.3390/ijms231810956,,2022,"Bengtson C, Silswal N, Baumlin N, Yoshida M, Dennis J, Yerrathota S, Kim M, Salathe M.",Y,MED
Clinical Effectiveness of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor in People with Cystic Fibrosis: A Clinical Trial.,"**Rationale:** The cystic fibrosis (CF) modulator drug, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), proved highly effective in controlled clinical trials for individuals with at least one F508del allele, which occurs in at least 85% of people with CF. **Objectives:** PROMISE is a postapproval study to understand the broad effects of ETI through 30 months' clinical use in a more diverse U.S. patient population with planned analyses after 6 months. **Methods:** Prospective, observational study in 487 people with CF age 12 years or older with at least one F508del allele starting ETI for the first time. Assessments occurred before and 1, 3, and 6 months into ETI therapy. Outcomes included change in percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1), sweat chloride concentration, body mass index (BMI), and self-reported respiratory symptoms. **Measurements and Main Results:** Average age was 25.1 years, and 44.1% entered the study using tezacaftor/ivacaftor or lumacaftor/ivacaftor, whereas 6.7% were using ivacaftor, consistent with F508del homozygosity and G551D allele, respectively. At 6 months into ETI therapy, ppFEV1 improved 9.76 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.76 to 10.76) from baseline, cystic fibrosis questionnaire-revised respiratory domain score improved 20.4 points (95% CI, 18.3 to 22.5), and sweat chloride decreased -41.7 mmol/L (95% CI, -43.8 to -39.6). BMI also significantly increased. Changes were larger in those naive to modulators but substantial in all groups, including those treated with ivacaftor at baseline. **Conclusions:** ETI by clinical prescription provided large improvements in lung function, respiratory symptoms, and BMI in a diverse population naive to modulator drug therapy, using existing two-drug combinations, or using ivacaftor alone. Each group also experienced significant reductions in sweat chloride concentration, which correlated with improved ppFEV1 in the overall study population.

Characterization of impaired beta and alpha cell function in response to an oral glucose challenge in cystic fibrosis: a cross-sectional study.,"Aims: The purpose of the study was to further elucidate the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis (CF)-related diabetes (CFRD) and potential drivers of hypoglycaemia. Hence, we aimed to describe and compare beta cell function (insulin and proinsulin) and alpha cell function (glucagon) in relation to glucose tolerance in adults with CF and to study whether hypoglycaemia following oral glucose challenge may represent an early sign of islet cell impairment.Methods: Adults with CF (≥18 years) were included in a cross-sectional study using an extended (-10, -1, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min) or a standard (-1, 30, 60, and 120 min) oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Participants were classified according to glucose tolerance status and hypoglycaemia was defined as 3-hour glucose <3.9 mmol/L in those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and early glucose intolerance (EGI).Results: Among 93 participants, 67 underwent an extended OGTT. In addition to worsening in insulin secretion, the progression to CFRD was associated with signs of beta cell stress, as the fasting proinsulin-to-insulin ratio incrementally increased (p-value for trend=0.013). The maximum proinsulin level (pmol/L) was positively associated with the nadir glucagon, as nadir glucagon increased 6.2% (95% confidence interval: 1.4-11.3%) for each unit increase in proinsulin. Those with hypoglycaemia had higher 60-min glucose, 120-min C-peptide, and 180-min glucagon levels (27.8% [11.3-46.7%], 42.9% [5.9-92.85%], and 80.3% [14.9-182.9%], respectively) and unaltered proinsulin-to-insulin ratio compared to those without hypoglycaemia.Conclusions: The maximum proinsulin concentration was positively associated with nadir glucagon during the OGTT, suggesting that beta cell stress is associated with abnormal alpha cell function in adults with CF. In addition, hypoglycaemia seemed to be explained by a temporal mismatch between glucose and insulin levels rather than by an impaired glucagon response.",37720541,PMC10501799,10.3389/fendo.2023.1249876,,2023,"Nielsen BU, Mathiesen IHM, Møller R, Krogh-Madsen R, Katzenstein TL, Pressler T, Shaw JAM, Ritz C, Rickels MR, Stefanovski D, Almdal TP, Faurholt-Jepsen D.",Y,MED
The Impact of Highly Effective CFTR Modulators on Growth and Nutrition Status.,"Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at increased risk of malnutrition and growth failure due to multiple factors as a result of suboptimal or absent function of the CFTR chloride channel protein. Dysfunctional CFTR contributes to increased energy expenditure, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency causing impaired dietary macronutrient digestion and absorption, intestinal dysbiosis, and impaired bile acid homeostasis. Poor nutritional status as a result of these mechanisms is associated with decreased lung function, worse clinical outcomes, and ultimately, increased mortality. Nutritional interventions addressing these mechanisms, such as pancreatic enzyme-replacement therapy and enteral caloric supplementation, have improved nutritional status and, by association, clinical outcomes. In the last decade, the advent of medications targeting defective CFTR proteins has revolutionized the care of patients with CF by reducing the overall impact of CFTR dysfunction. Below, we summarize the effects of highly effective CFTR modulators on nutritional status overall as well as specific factors including bile acid metabolism, pancreatic function, energy expenditure, and intestinal dysbiosis. The future of CF nutrition care will require a paradigm shift away from focusing on methods addressing CFTR dysfunction such as excess calorie provision and toward an individualized, holistic approach in the context of specific mutations and CFTR-directed therapy.",34578785,PMC8470943,10.3390/nu13092907,,2021,"Bass R, Brownell JN, Stallings VA.",Y,MED
Glycemia and β-cell function before and after elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in youth and adults with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Diabetes is prevalent among people with CF (PwCF) and associated with worse clinical outcomes. CFTR modulators are highly effective in improving the disease course of CF. However, the effects of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) on glucose metabolism in PwCF are unclear.Methods: Twenty youth and adults with CF underwent frequently sampled oral glucose tolerance tests (fsOGTT) before and after ETI initiation. Glucose, insulin, and C-peptide were collected at 0, 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after 1.75 g/kg (max 75 g) of dextrose. HbA1c and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) were collected in a subset. Estimates of insulin secretion (C-peptide index), insulin resistance (HOMA2 IR and IS(OGTT Cpep)), and β-cell function (C-peptide oral disposition index, oDIcoeo), were compared before and after ETI.Results: Participants were a median (IQR) of 20.4 (14.1, 28.6) years old, 75 % male. Follow-up occurred 10.5 (10.0, 12.3) months after ETI initiation. BMI z-score increased from 0.3 (-0.3, 0.8) to 0.8 (0.4, 1.5), p = 0.013 between visits.

Delayed hepatic necrosis in a cystic fibrosis patient taking Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (Kaftrio).,"The introduction of Cystic Fibrosis Trans Regulatory modulator (CFTRm) drugs has seen a transformation in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) treatment. This has led to a significant improvement in lung function and quality of life with the potential for a real impact on life expectancy. Transient mild to moderate hepatic transaminitis is a well-known side effect of CFTRm drugs, which often improves on cessation and may not recur following the re-institution of the drug. We describe a case of transaminitis developing nine months after the initiation of Kaftrio, which progressed to liver necrosis despite stopping Kaftrio and took many months to resolve. The patient had experienced significant improvement in lung function and overall health while on Kaftrio and deteriorated when it was stopped. He was keen to restart; however, Kaftrio was not reinstated due to the potential risk of acute liver failure.",34815934,PMC8593462,10.1016/j.rmcr.2021.101553,,2021,"Salehi M, Iqbal M, Dube A, AlJoudeh A, Edenborough F.",Y,MED

CFTR Modulator Therapies: Potential Impact on Airway Infections in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein, expressed on the apical surface of epithelial cells. CFTR absence/dysfunction results in ion imbalance and airway surface dehydration that severely compromise the CF airway microenvironment, increasing infection susceptibility. Recently, novel therapies aimed at correcting the basic CFTR defect have become available, leading to substantial clinical improvement of CF patients. The restoration or increase of CFTR function affects the airway microenvironment, improving local defence mechanisms. CFTR modulator drugs might therefore affect the development of chronic airway infections and/or improve the status of existing infections in CF. Thus far, however, the full extent of these effects of CFTR-modulators, especially in the long-term remains still unknown. This review aims to provide an overview of current evidence on the potential impact of CFTR modulators on airway infections in CF. Their role in affecting CF microbiology, the susceptibility to infections as well as the potential efficacy of their use in preventing/decreasing the development of chronic lung infections and the recurrent acute exacerbations in CF will be critically analysed.",35406809,PMC8998122,10.3390/cells11071243,,2022,"Saluzzo F, Riberi L, Messore B, Loré NI, Esposito I, Bignamini E, De Rose V.",Y,MED
Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor as a Final Frontier in the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis: Definition of the Clinical and Microbiological Implications in a Case-Control Study.,"The use of modulator drugs that target the Cystic Fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the final frontier in the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis (CF), a genetic multiorgan disease. F508del is the most common mutation causing defective formation and function of CFTR. Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor is the first triple combination of CFTR modulators. Herein, we report on a one-year case-control study that involved 26 patients with at least one F508del mutation. Patients were assigned to two similar groups, and patients with the worse clinical condition received treatment with the triple combination therapy. The study aimed to define the clinical and especially microbiological implications of treatment administration. The treatment provided significant clinical benefits in terms of respiratory, pancreatic, and sweat function. After one year of therapy, airway infection rates decreased and pulmonary exacerbations were dramatically reduced. Finally, treated patients reported a surprising improvement in their quality of life. The use of triple combination therapy has become essential in most CF people carrying the F508del mutation. Although the clinical and instrumental benefits of treatment are thoroughly known, further investigations are needed to properly define its microbiological respiratory implications and establish the real advantage of life-long treatment with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor.",35631432,PMC9145356,10.3390/ph15050606,,2022,"Migliorisi G, Collura M, Ficili F, Pensabene T, Bongiorno D, Collura A, Di Bernardo F, Stefani S.",Y,MED
CFTR Modulators Rescue the Activity of CFTR in Colonoids Expressing the Complex Allele p.[R74W;V201M;D1270N]/dele22_24.,"An Italian, 46-year-old female patient carrying the complex allele p.[R74W;V201M;D1270N] in trans with CFTR dele22_24 was diagnosed at the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Center of Verona as being affected by CF-pancreatic sufficient (CF-PS) in 2021. The variant V201M has unknown significance, while both of the other variants of this complex allele have variable clinical consequences, according to the CFTR2 database, with reported clinical benefits for treatment with ivacaftor + tezacaftor and ivacaftor + tezacaftor + elexacaftor in patients carrying the R74W-D1270N complex allele, which are currently approved (in USA, not yet in Italy). She was previously followed up by pneumologists in northern Italy because of frequent bronchitis, hemoptysis, recurrent rhinitis, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* lung colonization, bronchiectasis/atelectasis, bronchial arterial embolization and moderately compromised lung function (FEV1: 62%). Following a sweat test with borderline results, she was referred to the Verona CF Center where she presented abnormal values in both optical beta-adrenergic sweat tests and intestinal current measurement (ICM). These results were consistent with a diagnosis of CF. CFTR function analyses were also performed in vitro by forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) assay and short-circuit currents (Isc) in the monolayers of the rectal organoids. Both of these assays showed significantly increased CFTR activity following treatment with the CFTR modulators. Western-blot analysis revealed increased fully glycosylated CFTR protein after treatment with correctors, in line with the functional analysis. Interestingly, tezacaftor, together with elexacaftor, rescued the total organoid area under steady-state conditions, even in the absence of the CFTR agonist forskolin. In conclusion, in ex vivo and in vitro assays, we measured a residual function that was significantly enhanced by in vitro incubation with CFTR modulators, especially by ivacaftor + tezacaftor + elexacaftor, suggesting this combination as a potentially optimal treatment for this case.",36982273,PMC10048957,10.3390/ijms24065199,,2023,"Kleinfelder K, Somenza E, Farinazzo A, Conti J, Lotti V, Latorre RV, Rodella L, Massella A, Tomba F, Bertini M, Sorio C, Melotti P.",Y,MED
Trends in Growth and Maturation in Children with Cystic Fibrosis Throughout Nine Decades.,"Since cystic fibrosis (CF) was first described in 1938, there have been many discoveries and innovations in the field, each having a profound impact on survival, growth and quality of life. For example, the introduction of enteric-coated pancreatic enzyme microspheres increased fat absorption and improved nutritional status. Early detection of CF through newborn screening facilitated prompt nutritional intervention for infants at high risk of malnutrition. Use of anti-pseudomonal therapy, such as inhaled tobramycin, increased weight gain and pulmonary function in addition to reducing pulmonary exacerbations. Similarly, DNAse and hypertonic saline improved pulmonary function and reduced exacerbations. The identification of the *CFTR* gene and its protein product were fundamental in understanding the pathophysiology of CF and paved the way for advances in both diagnosis and management. In fact, CFTR modulator therapies have revolutionized the care for individuals with CF. Here, we examine the impact of these interventions on the nutritional status, growth and pubertal maturation of children and adolescents with CF.",35903281,PMC9317724,10.3389/fendo.2022.935354,,2022,"Mason KA, Rogol AD.",Y,MED
Pulmonary exacerbations in early cystic fibrosis lung disease are marked by strong modulation of CD3 and PD-1 on luminal T cells.,"Background: In chronic cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, neutrophilic inflammation and T-cell inhibition occur concomitantly, partly due to neutrophil-mediated release of the T-cell inhibitory enzyme Arg1. However, the onset of this tonic inhibition of T cells, and the impact of pulmonary exacerbations (PEs) on this process, remain unknown.Methods: Children with CF aged 0-5 years were enrolled in a longitudinal, single-center cohort study. Blood (n = 35) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (n = 18) were collected at stable outpatient clinic visits or inpatient PE hospitalizations and analyzed by flow cytometry (for immune cell presence and phenotype) and 20-plex chemiluminescence assay (for immune mediators). Patients were categorized by PE history into (i) no prior PE, (ii) past history of PE prior to stable visit, or (iii) current PE.Results: PEs were associated with increased concentration of both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in BAL, and increased neutrophil frequency and G-CSF in circulation. PE BAL samples showed a trend toward an increased frequency of hyperexocytic ""GRIM"" neutrophils, which we previously identified in chronic CF. Interestingly, expression levels of the T-cell receptor associated molecule CD3 and of the inhibitory programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor were respectively decreased and increased on T cells from BAL compared to blood in all patients. When categorized by PE status, CD3 and PD-1 expression on blood T cells did not differ among patients, while CD3 expression was decreased, and PD-1 expression was increased on BAL T cells from patients with current PE.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that airway T cells are engaged during early-life PEs, prior to the onset of chronic neutrophilic inflammation in CF. In addition, increased blood neutrophil frequency and a trend toward increased BAL frequency of hyperexocytic neutrophils suggest that childhood PEs may progressively shift the balance of CF airway immunity towards neutrophil dominance.",37809107,PMC10551126,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1194253,,2023,"Giacalone VD, Giraldo DM, Silva GL, Hosten J, Peng L, Guglani L, Tirouvanziam R.",Y,MED
Screening for Cystic Fibrosis Related Complications in the Context of a Pandemic and Altered Models of Care.,"Background: Standard of care recommend that patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) require screening investigations to assess for complications. Changing models of care due to the COVID19 pandemic may have impacted completion of recommended screening.Objective: To compare the frequency of screening investigations completed in people with CF before and after the onset of the COVID19 pandemic.Methods: Medical records were reviewed at 4 CF-specialist centers to identify screening investigations completed in the 12-months before and after pandemic onset.Results: Records of 625 patients were reviewed. Prior to pandemic onset, there was between center variability in completion of screening investigations. There was greatest baseline variation between centers in performing oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT); range 38%-69%, exercise tests; 3%-51% and sputum screening for non-tuberculous mycobacteria; 53%-81%. Following pandemic onset, blood tests, and sputum cultures were maintained at the highest rates. Exercise testing, CXR and OGTT exhibited the greatest declines, with reductions at individual centers ranging between 10%-24%, 22%-43%, and 20%-26%, respectively. Return to in-person visits following pandemic onset was variable, ranging from 16% to 74% between centers.Conclusion: Completion of screening investigations varies between CF centers and changes in models of care, such as increased virtual care in response to COVID19 pandemic was associated with reduction in completion of investigations. Centers would benefit from auditing their adherence to standards of care, particularly considering recent changes in care delivery.",37854074,PMC10580724,10.1177/11786329231205145,,2023,"Doumit M, Strachan R, Lazarus R, Middleton P, Dentice R, Marouvo J, Jeffrey L, Selvadurai H, Sivam S, Pacey V, Jaffe A, Gray K.",Y,MED
Unlocking the Future: Pluripotent Stem Cell-Based Lung Repair.,"The human respiratory system is susceptible to a variety of diseases, ranging from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary fibrosis to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Today, lung diseases represent one of the major challenges to the health care sector and represent one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Current treatment options often focus on managing symptoms rather than addressing the underlying cause of the disease. The limitations of conventional therapies highlight the urgent clinical need for innovative solutions capable of repairing damaged lung tissue at a fundamental level. Pluripotent stem cell technologies have now reached clinical maturity and hold immense potential to revolutionize the landscape of lung repair and regenerative medicine. Meanwhile, human embryonic (HESCs) and human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can be coaxed to differentiate into lung-specific cell types such as bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, or pulmonary endothelial cells. This holds the promise of regenerating damaged lung tissue and restoring normal respiratory function. While methods for targeted genetic engineering of hPSCs and lung cell differentiation have substantially advanced, the required GMP-grade clinical-scale production technologies as well as the development of suitable preclinical animal models and cell application strategies are less advanced. This review provides an overview of current perspectives on PSC-based therapies for lung repair, explores key advances, and envisions future directions in this dynamic field.",38607074,PMC11012168,10.3390/cells13070635,,2024,"Goecke T, Ius F, Ruhparwar A, Martin U.",Y,MED
Revisiting Host-Pathogen Interactions in Cystic Fibrosis Lungs in the Era of CFTR Modulators.,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators, a new series of therapeutics that correct and potentiate some classes of mutations of the CFTR, have provided a great therapeutic advantage to people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). The main hindrances of the present CFTR modulators are related to their limitations in reducing chronic lung bacterial infection and inflammation, the main causes of pulmonary tissue damage and progressive respiratory insufficiency, particularly in adults with CF. Here, the most debated issues of the pulmonary bacterial infection and inflammatory processes in pwCF are revisited. Special attention is given to the mechanisms favoring the bacterial infection of pwCF, the progressive adaptation of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and its interplay with *Staphylococcus aureus*, the cross-talk among bacteria, the bronchial epithelial cells and the phagocytes of the host immune defenses. The most recent findings of the effect of CFTR modulators on bacterial infection and the inflammatory process are also presented to provide critical hints towards the identification of relevant therapeutic targets to overcome the respiratory pathology of pwCF.",36902441,PMC10003689,10.3390/ijms24055010,,2023,"Ribeiro CMP, Higgs MG, Muhlebach MS, Wolfgang MC, Borgatti M, Lampronti I, Cabrini G.",Y,MED
*In silico* analysis and theratyping of an ultra-rare CFTR genotype (W57G/A234D) in primary human rectal and nasal epithelial cells.,"Mutation targeted therapy in cystic fibrosis (CF) is still not eligible for all CF subjects, especially for cases carrying rare variants such as the CFTR genotype W57G/A234D (c.169T>G/c.701C>A). We performed *in silico* analysis of the effects of these variants on protein stability, which we functionally characterized using colonoids and reprogrammed nasal epithelial cells. The effect of mutations on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein was analyzed by western blotting, forskolin-induced swelling (FIS), and Ussing chamber analysis. We detected a residual CFTR function that increases following treatment with the CFTR modulators VX661±VX445±VX770, correlates among models, and is associated with increased CFTR protein levels following treatment with CFTR correctors. *In vivo* treatment with VX770 reduced sweat chloride concentration to non-CF levels, increased the number of CFTR-dependent sweat droplets, and induced a 6% absolute increase in predicted FEV1% after 27 weeks of treatment indicating the relevance of theratyping with patient-derived cells in CF.",38026150,PMC10660498,10.1016/j.isci.2023.108180,,2023,"Kleinfelder K, Lotti V, Eramo A, Amato F, Lo Cicero S, Castelli G, Spadaro F, Farinazzo A, Dell'Orco D, Preato S, Conti J, Rodella L, Tomba F, Cerofolini A, Baldisseri E, Bertini M, Volpi S, Villella VR, Esposito S, Zollo I, Castaldo G, Laudanna C, Sorsher EJ, Hong J, Joshi D, Cutting G, Lucarelli M, Melotti P, Sorio C.",Y,MED
The cardiomyopathy of cystic fibrosis: a modern form of Keshan disease.,"Introduction: We conducted a study to determine the prevalence of structural heart disease in patients with CF, the characteristics of a cardiomyopathy not previously described in this population, and its possible relationship with nutritional deficiencies in CF.Methods: We studied 3 CMP CF patients referred for heart-lung transplantation and a prospective series of 120 adult CF patients. All patients underwent a clinical examination, blood tests including levels of vitamins and trace elements, and echocardiography with evaluation of myocardial strain. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was performed in patients with CMP and in a control group. Histopathological study was performed on hearts obtained in transplant or necropsy.Results: We found a prevalence of 10% (CI 4.6%-15.4%) of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in the prospective cohort. Myocardial strain parameters were already altered in CF patients with otherwise normal hearts. Histopathological examination of 4 hearts from CF CMP patients showed a unique histological pattern of multifocal myocardial fibrosis similar to Keshan disease. Four of the five CF CMP patients undergoing CMR showed late gadolinium uptake, with a characteristic patchy pattern in 3 cases (*p* < 0.001 vs. CF controls). Selenium deficiency (Se < 60 µg/L) was associated with more severe LV dysfunction, higher prevalence of CF CMP, higher NTproBNP levels, and more severe pulmonary and digestive involvement.Conclusion: 10% of adults with CF showed significant cardiac involvement, with histological and imaging features resembling Keshan disease.

"Intestinal Inflammation and Alterations in the Gut Microbiota in Cystic Fibrosis: A Review of the Current Evidence, Pathophysiology and Future Directions.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting autosomal recessive multisystem disease. While its burden of morbidity and mortality is classically associated with pulmonary disease, CF also profoundly affects the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Chronic low-grade inflammation and alterations to the gut microbiota are hallmarks of the CF intestine. The etiology of these manifestations is likely multifactorial, resulting from cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction, a high-fat CF diet, and the use of antibiotics. There may also be a bidirectional pathophysiological link between intestinal inflammation and changes to the gut microbiome. Additionally, a growing body of evidence suggests that these GI manifestations may have significant clinical associations with growth and nutrition, quality of life, and respiratory function in CF. As such, the potential utility of GI therapies and long-term GI outcomes are areas of interest in CF. Further research involving microbial modulation and multi-omics techniques may reveal novel insights. This article provides an overview of the current evidence, pathophysiology, and future research and therapeutic considerations pertaining to intestinal inflammation and alterations in the gut microbiota in CF.",35160099,PMC8836727,10.3390/jcm11030649,,2022,"Tam RY, van Dorst JM, McKay I, Coffey M, Ooi CY.",Y,MED
"Comparative effects of CFTR modulators on phagocytic, metabolic and inflammatory profiles of CF and nonCF macrophages.","Macrophage dysfunction has been well-described in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and may contribute to bacterial persistence in the lung. Whether CF macrophage dysfunction is related directly to Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) in macrophages or an indirect consequence of chronic inflammation and mucostasis is a subject of ongoing debate. CFTR modulators that restore CFTR function in epithelial cells improve global CF monocyte inflammatory responses but their direct effects on macrophages are less well understood. To address this knowledge gap, we measured phagocytosis, metabolism, and cytokine expression in response to a classical CF pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) isolated from CF F508del homozygous subjects and nonCF controls. Unexpectedly, we found that CFTR modulators enhanced phagocytosis in both CF and nonCF cohorts. CFTR triple modulators also inhibited MDM mitochondrial function, consistent with MDM activation. In contrast to studies in humans where CFTR modulators decreased serum inflammatory cytokine levels, modulators did not alter cytokine secretion in our system. Our studies therefore suggest modulator induced metabolic effects may promote bacterial clearance in both CF and nonCF monocyte-derived macrophages.",37491532,PMC10368712,10.1038/s41598-023-38300-9,,2023,"Aridgides DS, Mellinger DL, Gwilt LL, Hampton TH, Mould DL, Hogan DA, Ashare A.",Y,MED
Long-term effectiveness of dual CFTR modulator treatment of cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Although short-term efficacy of lumacaftor/ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor is clearly established in clinical trials, data on long-term effectiveness is limited. This registry-based cohort study assessed real-world longitudinal outcomes of F508del-homozygous people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) ≥12 years, up to 3 years after the introduction of dual cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators.Methods: Annual data (2010-2019) were retrieved from the Dutch Cystic Fibrosis Registry. Longitudinal trends of per cent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 % pred) decline, body mass index (BMI), BMI Z-score and intravenous antibiotic treatment duration before and after CFTR modulator initiation were assessed with linear and negative binomial mixed models.Results: We included 401 participants (41.9% female, baseline age 24.5 years (IQR 18.0-31.5 years), baseline mean±sd FEV1 70.5±23.4% pred). FEV1 decline improved from -1.36% pred per year to -0.48% pred per year after modulator initiation (change: 0.88% pred, 95% CI: 0.35-1.39%, p=0.001). This change was even 1.40% pred per year (95% CI: -0.0001-2.82%, p=0.050) higher in participants with baseline FEV1 <40% pred. In adults, annual BMI trend was not altered (change: 0.10 kg·m-2·year-1, 95% CI:-0.01-0.21, p=0.079). Annual BMI Z-score in children reversed from -0.08 per year before modulator treatment to 0.06 per year afterwards (change: 0.14 per year, 95% CI: 0.06-0.22, p<0.001). Intravenous antibiotic treatment duration showed a three-fold reduction in the first year after modulator initiation (incidence rate ratios (IRR): 0.28, 95% CI: 0.19-0.40, p<0.001), but the annual trend did not change in the subsequent years (IRR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.94-1.50, p=0.153).Conclusion: Long-term effectiveness of dual CFTR modulator therapies on FEV1 decline, BMI and intravenous antibiotic treatment duration is less pronounced in a real-world setting than in clinical trials and varies considerably between pwCF and different baseline FEV1 levels.",36382237,PMC9661249,10.1183/23120541.00204-2022,,2022,"Muilwijk D, Zomer-van Ommen DD, Gulmans VAM, Eijkemans MJC, van der Ent CK, Dutch Cystic Fibrosis Registry (NCFR) Steering Group: .",Y,MED
CFTR Modulator Therapy with Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor Alters Plasma Concentrations of Lipid-Soluble Vitamins A and E in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Rationale: Cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, leads to impaired pancreatic function and therefore reduced intestinal absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins especially in patients with CF developing pancreatic insufficiency (PI). Previous studies showed that CFTR modulator therapy with lumacaftor-ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) in Phe508del-homozygous patients with CF results in improvement of pulmonary disease and thriving. However, the effects of LUM/IVA on plasma concentration of the lipid soluble vitamins A and E remain unknown.Objectives: To investigate the course of plasma vitamin A and E in patients with CF under LUM/IVA therapy.Methods: Data from annual follow-up examinations of patients with CF were obtained to assess clinical outcomes including pulmonary function status, body mass index (BMI), and clinical chemistry as well as fat-soluble vitamins in Phe508del-homozygous CF patients before initiation and during LUM/IVA therapy.Results: Patients with CF receiving LUM/IVA improved substantially, including improvement in pulmonary inflammation, associated with a decrease in blood immunoglobulin G (IgG) from 9.4 to 8.2 g/L after two years (*p* < 0.001). During the same time, plasma vitamin A increased significantly from 1.2 to 1.6 µmol/L (*p* < 0.05), however, levels above the upper limit of normal were not detected in any of the patients. In contrast, plasma vitamin E as vitamin E/cholesterol ratio decreased moderately over the same time from 6.2 to 5.5 µmol/L (*p* < 0.01).Conclusions: CFTR modulator therapy with LUM/IVA alters concentrations of vitamins A and vitamin E in plasma.

The Effect of CFTR Modulators on Airway Infection in Cystic Fibrosis.,"The advent of Cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor (CFTR) modulators in 2012 was a critical event in the history of cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment. Unlike traditional therapies that target downstream effects of CFTR dysfunction, CFTR modulators aim to correct the underlying defect at the protein level. These genotype-specific therapies are now available for an increasing number of CF patients, transforming the way we view the condition from a life-limiting disease to one that can be effectively managed. Several studies have demonstrated the vast improvement CFTR modulators have on normalization of sweat chloride, CFTR function, clinical endpoints, and frequency of pulmonary exacerbation. However, their impact on other aspects of the disease, such as pathogenic burden and airway infection, remain under explored. Frequent airway infections as a result of increased susceptibility and impaired innate immune response are a serious problem within CF, often leading to accelerated decline in lung function and disease progression. Current evidence suggests that CFTR modulators are unable to eradicate pathogenic organisms in those with already established lung disease. However, this may not be the case for those with relatively low levels of disease progression and conserved microbial diversity, such as young patients. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether the restorative effects exerted by CFTR modulators extend to immune cells, such as phagocytes, which have the potential to modulate the response of people with CF (pwCF) to infection. Throughout this review, we look at the potential impact of CFTR modulators on airway infection in CF and their ability to shape impaired pulmonary defences to pathogens.",35408875,PMC8998472,10.3390/ijms23073513,,2022,"Harvey C, Weldon S, Elborn S, Downey DG, Taggart C.",Y,MED
Prospectively evaluating maternal and fetal outcomes in the era of CFTR modulators: the MAYFLOWERS observational clinical trial study design.,"Introduction: Therapeutic advances have markedly increased life expectancy for those with cystic fibrosis (CF), resulting in a median predicted survival over 50 years. Consequently, people with CF (pwCF) are living through their reproductive years and the rate of pregnancy is rapidly rising. Despite the increased relevance of this topic, multicentre studies investigating the association between maternal health and choices made during pregnancy on maternal and fetal outcomes do not exist. Furthermore, there are very limited data on the outcomes following CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator use during pregnancy and lactation.Methods and analysis: *Ma*ternal and *F*eta*l O*utcomes in the *E*ra of Modulato*rs* (MAYFLOWERS) is a prospective, multicentre observational clinical trial which will enrol approximately 285 pregnant pwCF including those who are modulator ineligible and those who choose to continue or discontinue CFTR modulator therapy during pregnancy and lactation. The primary aim of this 35-month study is to assess whether lung function changes during pregnancy differ based on the continued use of modulators or other factors such as pre-existing comorbid conditions.

Furin as a therapeutic target in cystic fibrosis airways disease.,"Clinical management of cystic fibrosis (CF) has been greatly improved by the development of small molecule modulators of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). These drugs help to address some of the basic genetic defects of CFTR; however, no suitable CFTR modulators exist for 10% of people with CF (PWCF). An alternative, mutation-agnostic therapeutic approach is therefore still required. In CF airways, elevated levels of the proprotein convertase furin contribute to the dysregulation of key processes that drive disease pathogenesis. Furin plays a critical role in the proteolytic activation of the epithelial sodium channel; hyperactivity of which causes airways dehydration and loss of effective mucociliary clearance. Furin is also responsible for the processing of transforming growth factor-β, which is increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from PWCF and is associated with neutrophilic inflammation and reduced pulmonary function. Pathogenic substrates of furin include *Pseudomonas* exotoxin A, a major toxic product associated with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infection and the spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causative pathogen for coronavirus disease 2019. In this review we discuss the importance of furin substrates in the progression of CF airways disease and highlight selective furin inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to provide clinical benefit to all PWCF.",37137509,PMC10155048,10.1183/16000617.0256-2022,,2023,"Douglas LEJ, Reihill JA, Montgomery BM, Martin SL.",Y,MED

Dynamics of abdominal symptoms during the start of a new therapy with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor using the novel CFAbd-day2day questionnaire.,"**Background:** Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) is a novel, highly effective CFTR modulator combination proven to enhance lung function and body weight in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) carrying a F508del mutation. Recently, we revealed significant reductions in abdominal symptoms (AS) in German, British, and Irish pwCF after 24-26 weeks of ETI using the CFAbd-Score, the first patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) specifically developed and validated for pwCF following FDA guidelines. Notably, many pwCF reported marked changes in their AS during the first days of the new treatment. To capture these immediate effects, we developed the CFAbd-day2day, a CF-specific GI-diary, following FDA and COSMIN guidelines. **Aim:** To prospectively capture the immediate dynamics of AS using the CFAbd-day2day 14 days before and 14-28 days after ETI initiation. In addition, we aim to provide validation steps of the novel PROM concerning sensitivity to changes. **Methods:** To develop the CFAbd-day2day, focus groups (community voice = pwCF and their proxies and CF specialists from different fields) were repeatedly consulted. Before and during the new ETI therapy, pwCF prospectively scored AS on a daily basis with the CFAbd-day2day. **Results:** Altogether, 45 pwCF attended in five CF centers prospectively completed the CFAbd-day2day before (mean ± sd:14 ± 7 days) and after (mean ± sd: 28 ± 23 days) ETI initiation. On the one hand, cumulative scores significantly decreased during the 3-4-week time frame after ETI initiation, compared to 2 weeks prior to therapy. On the other hand, many patients who revealed a relatively stable level of AS before ETI reported changes during the first days of treatment with the highly effective CFTR modulators. Factors like pain and flatulence increased in up to 21% of patients during the first 14 days of therapy, but they improved during days 15-27. **Conclusion:** The CFAbd-day2day, specifically developed and in the process of validation to prospectively capture GI symptoms in pwCF, provides new substantial insights into the dynamics of AS in pwCF receiving a new treatment with ETI. This novel tool is also helpful in prospectively monitoring patients with specific GI problems.

Advancing Treatment Strategies: A Comprehensive Review of Drug Delivery Innovations for Chronic Inflammatory Respiratory Diseases.,"Chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis, present ongoing challenges in terms of effective treatment and management. These diseases are characterized by persistent inflammation in the airways, leading to structural changes and compromised lung function. There are several treatments available for them, such as bronchodilators, immunomodulators, and oxygen therapy. However, there are still some shortcomings in the effectiveness and side effects of drugs. To achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes while minimizing systemic side effects, targeted therapies and precise drug delivery systems are crucial to the management of these diseases. This comprehensive review focuses on the role of drug delivery systems in chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases, particularly nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), novel biologicals, gene therapy, and personalized medicine. By examining the latest advancements and strategies in these areas, we aim to provide a thorough understanding of the current landscape and future prospects for improving treatment outcomes in these challenging conditions.",37631365,PMC10458134,10.3390/pharmaceutics15082151,,2023,"Wang J, Wang P, Shao Y, He D.",Y,MED
The role of modulators in cystic fibrosis related diabetes.,"The development and introduction of modulator therapies have completely shifted the paradigm for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). Highly effective modulator therapies have driven marked improvements in lung function, exacerbation rate, weight and quality of life in CF patients. However, their effect on CF related diabetes (CFRD) is not well delineated. The role of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in CFRD pathogenesis is inadequately understood and research aimed at deciphering the underlying mechanisms of CFRD continues to evolve. In this review, we summarize what is known regarding the effect of CFTR modulators on CFRD. Small studies using ivacaftor monotherapy in gating mutations have revealed improvement in insulin secretion, glucose tolerance and/or decrease in insulin requirement. However, lumacaftor/ivacaftor studies (primarily in delta F 508 homozygous) have not revealed significant improvement in CFRD or glucose tolerance. No studies are yet available regarding the effect of the highly effective triple therapy (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) on CFRD or insulin secretion. CFTR modulators might affect development or progression of CFRD through many mechanisms including improving insulin secretion by correcting the CFTR defect directly, improving ductal function, reducing islet inflammation, and improving incretin secretion or by enhancing insulin sensitivity via reduced systemic inflammation and increased physical activity driven by improved lung function and quality of life. On the other hand, they can stimulate appetite and improve gastrointestinal function resulting in increased caloric intake and absorption, driving excessive weight gain and potentially increased insulin resistance. If the defect in insulin secretion is reversible then it is possible that initiation of CFTR modulators at a younger age might help prevent CFRD. Despite the advances in CF management, CFRD remains a challenge and knowledge continues to evolve. Future studies will drive better understanding of the role of highly effective CFTR modulators in CFRD.",34917484,PMC8668978,10.1016/j.jcte.2021.100286,,2022,"Merjaneh L, Hasan S, Kasim N, Ode KL.",Y,MED
"Efficacy and safety of inhaled ENaC inhibitor BI 1265162 in patients with cystic fibrosis: BALANCE-CF 1, a randomised, phase II study.","Background: Inhibition of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in cystic fibrosis (CF) airways provides a mutation-agnostic approach that could improve mucociliary clearance in all CF patients. BI 1265162 is an ENaC inhibitor with demonstrated pre-clinical efficacy and safety already demonstrated in humans.Objective: We present results from BALANCE-CFTM 1, a phase II, placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind study of four dose levels of BI 1265162 *versus* placebo for 4 weeks on top of standard of care in adults and adolescents with CF.Results: Initially, 28 randomised subjects (BI 1265162 200 µg twice daily n=14, placebo twice daily n=14) were assessed at an interim futility analysis. Compared with placebo, numerical changes of -0.8% (95% CI -6.6 to 4.9%) in percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1s (ppFEV1) and +2.1 units (95% CI -2.4 to 6.5 units) in lung clearance index (LCI) were observed in the active group, meeting a pre-defined stopping rule; accordingly, the study was terminated. Recruitment had continued during the interim analysis and pending results; 24 patients were added across three dose levels and placebo. The final results including these patients (+1.5% ppFEV1, 200 µg twice-daily dose *versus* placebo) were not supportive of relevant clinical effect. Furthermore, LCI change was not supportive, although interpretation was limited due to insufficient traces meeting quality criteria. A 9.4-point improvement in the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised Respiratory Domain was observed in the 200 µg twice daily dose group *versus* placebo. BI 1265162 up to 200 µg twice daily was safe and well-tolerated. Pharmacokinetics were similar to those in healthy volunteers.Conclusion: BI 1265162 was safe, but did not demonstrate a potential for clinical benefit.

Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis Patients Homozygous for *F508del* with Lumacaftor-Ivacaftor (Orkambi®) Restores Defective CFTR Channel Function in Circulating Mononuclear Cells.,"The treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients homozygous for the *F508del* mutation with Orkambi®, a combination of a corrector (lumacaftor) and a potentiator (ivacaftor) of the mutated CFTR protein, resulted in some amelioration of the respiratory function. However, a great variability in the clinical response was also observed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the response to Orkambi® in a small cohort of F508del/F508del patients (*n* = 14) in terms of clinical and laboratory parameters, including ex vivo CFTR activity in mononuclear cells (MNCs), during a 12-month treatment. Patients responded with an increase in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1%) and body mass index (BMI) as well as with a decrease in white blood cell (WBC) total counts and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, although not significantly. Sweat chloride and CFTR-dependent chloride efflux were found to decrease and increase, respectively, as compared with pre-therapy values. CFTR and BMI showed a statistically significant correlation during Orkambi® treatment. Clustering analysis showed that CFTR, BMI, sweat chloride, FEV1%, and WBC were strongly associated. These data support the notion that CFTR-dependent chloride efflux in MNCs should be investigated as a sensitive outcome measure of Orkambi® treatment in CF patients.",32244302,PMC7177453,10.3390/ijms21072398,,2020,"Favia M, Gallo C, Guerra L, De Venuto D, Diana A, Polizzi AM, Montemurro P, Mariggiò MA, Leonetti G, Manca A, Casavola V, Conese M.",Y,MED
SARS-CoV-2 and Burkholderia cenocepacia infection in a patient with Cystic Fibrosis: An unfavourable conjunction?,"The effects of the concomitant infection by COVID-19 and Burkholderia cepacia (Bc) in CF are not known. We describe the case of a 34 years woman with CF, colonized by Bc and found SARS-CoV2 positive. In the first hospital week she suffered acute respiratory failure and chest imaging showed interstitial involvement and multiple thickenings. She was treated with antibiotics, dexamethasone, remdesivir and heparin, with gradual improvement and discharge at day 20th. The reciprocal role of SARS-CoV-2 and Bc, their potential interactions and the contribution of the individual therapies to the favourable outcome are unclear. It is debatable whether it was SARS-CoV2 that triggered a Bc pulmonary exacerbation or if the chronic Bc infection facilitated the development of a COVID-19 more aggressive than usually seen in CF. If the latter hypothesis were confirmed by similar cases, Bc colonization should be regarded as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 expression in CF.",33883098,PMC8030994,10.1016/j.jcf.2021.03.024,,2021,"Olcese C, Casciaro R, Pirlo D, Debbia C, Castagnola E, Cresta F, Castellani C.",Y,MED

Cystic Fibrosis Patients with F508del/Minimal Function Genotype: Laboratory and Nutritional Evaluations after One Year of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor Treatment.,"The last ten years have been characterized by an enormous step forward in the therapy and management of patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), thanks to the development and combination of *Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Receptor* (*CFTR*) correctors and potentiators. Specifically, the last approved triple combination elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor has been demonstrated to improve lung function in CF patients with both homozygous Phe508del and Phe508del/minimal function genotypes. Here we have assessed the effect of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in patients carrying the Phe508del/minimal function genotype (*n* = 20) after one year of treatments on liver function and nutrient absorption with a focus on lipid metabolism. We show that weight, BMI, and albumin significantly increase, suggesting a positive impact of the treatment on nutrient absorption. Furthermore, cholesterol levels as a biomarker of lipid metabolism increased significantly after one year of treatment. Most importantly, we suggest that these results were not dependent on the diet composition, possibly indicating that the drug improves the hepatic synthesis and secretion of proteins and cholesterol.",36498475,PMC9735556,10.3390/jcm11236900,,2022,"Carnovale V, Scialò F, Gelzo M, Iacotucci P, Amato F, Zarrilli F, Celardo A, Castaldo G, Corso G.",Y,MED
Whole blood RNA-seq demonstrates an increased host immune response in individuals with cystic fibrosis who develop nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease.,"Background: Individuals with cystic fibrosis have an elevated lifetime risk of colonization, infection, and disease caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria. A prior study involving non-cystic fibrosis individuals reported a gene expression signature associated with susceptibility to nontuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary disease (NTM-PD). In this study, we determined whether people living with cystic fibrosis who progress to NTM-PD have a gene expression pattern similar to the one seen in the non-cystic fibrosis population.Methods: We evaluated whole blood transcriptomics using bulk RNA-seq in a cohort of cystic fibrosis patients with samples collected closest in timing to the first isolation of nontuberculous mycobacteria. The study population included patients who did (n = 12) and did not (n = 30) develop NTM-PD following the first mycobacterial growth. Progression to NTM-PD was defined by a consensus of two expert clinicians based on reviewing clinical, microbiological, and radiological information. Differential gene expression was determined by DESeq2.Results: No differences in demographics or composition of white blood cell populations between groups were identified at baseline. Out of 213 genes associated with NTM-PD in the non-CF population, only two were significantly different in our cystic fibrosis NTM-PD cohort. Gene set enrichment analysis of the differential expression results showed that CF individuals who developed NTM-PD had higher expression levels of genes involved in the interferon (α and γ), tumor necrosis factor, and IL6-STAT3-JAK pathways.Conclusion: In contrast to the non-cystic fibrosis population, the gene expression signature of patients with cystic fibrosis who develop NTM-PD is characterized by increased innate immune responses.",36480571,PMC9731410,10.1371/journal.pone.0278296,,2022,"Prieto MD, Jang J, Franciosi AN, Av-Gay Y, Bach H, Tebbutt SJ, Quon BS.",Y,MED

Recombinant ELX/TEZ/IVA-bound Phe508del CFTR exhibits a wild type conformation *in vitro*, but in patient's tissue a CFTR glyoisoform is synthesized that is distinct from the wild type and Phe508del isoforms. ELX/TEZ/IVA therapy improved the quality of life of people with CF in the real-life setting irrespective of their anthropometry and lung function at baseline. ELX/TEZ/IVA improved sinonasal and abdominal disease, lung function and morphology, airway microbiology and the basic defect of impaired epithelial chloride and bicarbonate transport.

Clinical and Functional Characteristics of the E92K *CFTR* Gene Variant in the Russian and Turkish Population of People with Cystic Fibrosis.,"The pathogenic variant E92K (c.274G > A) of the *CFTR* gene is rare in America and Europe, but it is common for people with cystic fibrosis from Russia and Turkey. We studied the effect of the E92K genetic variant on the CFTR function. The function of the CFTR channel was studied using the intestinal current measurements (ICM) method. The effects of CFTR modulators on the restoration of the CFTR function were studied in the model of intestinal organoids. To assess the effect of E92K on pre-mRNA splicing, the RT-PCR products obtained from patients' intestinal organoid cultures were analyzed. Patients with the genetic variant E92K are characterized by an older age of diagnosis compared to homozygotes F508del and a high frequency of pancreatic sufficiency. The results of the sweat test and the ICM method showed partial preservation of the function of the CFTR channel. Functional analysis of *CFTR* gene expression revealed a weak effect of the E92K variant on mRNA-CFTR splicing. Lumacaftor (VX-809) has been shown to restore CFTR function in an intestinal organoid model, which allows us to consider the E92K variant as a promising target for therapy with CFTR correctors.",37047318,PMC10093870,10.3390/ijms24076351,,2023,"Kondratyeva E, Melyanovskaya Y, Bulatenko N, Davydenko K, Filatova A, Efremova A, Skoblov M, Bukharova T, Sherman V, Voronkova A, Zhekaite E, Krasovskiy S, Amelina E, Petrova N, Polyakov A, Adyan T, Starinova M, Krasnova M, Vasilyev A, Makhnach O, Zinchenko R, Kutsev S, Gokdemir Y, Karadag B, Goldshtein D.",Y,MED
Nasal epithelial cell culture fluorescence recovery after photobleaching predicts cystic fibrosis therapeutic response.,"Background: Human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells can be sampled noninvasively and cultured to provide a model of the airway epithelium that reflects cystic fibrosis (CF) pathophysiology. We hypothesised that *in vitro* measures of HNE cell physiology would correlate directly with *in vivo* measures of lung physiology and therapeutic response, providing a framework for using HNE cells for therapeutic development and precision medicine.Methods: We sampled nasal cells from participants with CF (CF group, n=26), healthy controls (HC group, n=14) and single CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation carrier parents of the CF group (CR group, n=16). Participants underwent lung physiology and sweat chloride testing, and nuclear imaging-based measurement of mucociliary clearance (MCC) and small-molecule absorption (ABS). CF participants completed a second imaging day that included hypertonic saline (HS) inhalation to assess therapeutic response in terms of MCC. HNE measurements included Ussing chamber electrophysiology, small-molecule and liquid absorption rates, and particle diffusion rates through the HNE airway surface liquid (ASL) measured using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP).Results: Long FRAP diffusion times were associated with increased MCC response to HS in CF. This implies a strong relationship between inherent factors affecting ASL mucin concentration and therapeutic response to a hydrating therapy. MCC decreased with age in the CR group, which had a larger range of ages than the other two groups. Likely this indicates a general age-related effect that may be accentuated in this group. Measures of lung ABS correlated with sweat chloride in both the HC and CF groups, indicating that CFTR function drives this measure of paracellular small-molecule probe absorption.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the utility of HNE cultures for assessing therapeutic response for hydrating therapies. *In vitro* measurements of FRAP were particularly useful for predicting response and for characterising important properties of ASL mucus that were ultimately reflected in lung physiology.",36655223,PMC9835985,10.1183/23120541.00382-2022,,2022,"Corcoran TE, Bertrand CA, Myerburg MM, Weiner DJ, Frizzell SA, Li A, Agostini B, Parker RS, Shapiro ME, Muthukrishnan A, Hages ND, Mulhern BP, Pilewski JM.",Y,MED
How Clinically Efficient Is Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor for Cystic Fibrosis Patients? An Updated Literature Review.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive illness caused by the defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. These patients suffer from repeated chronic sinuses and lung infections, resulting in frequent hospital admissions and antibiotic (Abx) courses. These are the major contributing factors responsible for a low health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and increasing the disease burden. The introduction and approval of CFTR modulators-lumacaftor (LUM) and ivacaftor (IVA) in 2015 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reduced the mortality and morbidity rates associated with the disease. In 2018, the FDA approved these drugs from age two and five years with two copies of F5806 del. This literature review aims to present the studies centered on the clinical effects of LUM/IVA. We searched for the relevant articles, from 2016 to 2020, in PubMed Central (PMC), Google Scholars, and Journal of Cystic Fibrosis. LUM/IVA has a broader range of effects. They showed marked improvement in the reduction of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), Hospitalization rates, Abx use, and modification in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) status of pre-existing severe lung disease. Now, there is a need for an initiative to conduct more clinical trials and studies in the future to assess and evaluate the long-term clinical benefits and safety of LUM/IVA therapy in all age groups.",33520477,PMC7834585,10.7759/cureus.12251,,2020,"Perveen S, Chaudhry MR, AlBabtain S, Amreen S, Brar SK, Zeb M, Khan S.",Y,MED
Longitudinal Study of Therapeutic Adherence in a Cystic Fibrosis Unit: Identifying Potential Factors Associated with Medication Possession Ratio.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic and multisystemic disease that requires a high therapeutic demand for its control. The aim of this study was to assess therapeutic adherence (TA) to different treatments to study possible clinical consequences and clinical factors influencing adherence. This is an ambispective observational study of 57 patients aged over 18 years with a diagnosis of CF. The assessment of TA was calculated using the Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) index. These data were related to exacerbations and the rate of decline in FEV1 percentage. Compliance was good for all CFTR modulators, azithromycin, aztreonam, and tobramycin in solution for inhalation. The patients with the best compliance were older; they had exacerbations and the greatest deterioration in lung function during this period. The three variables with the highest importance for the compliance of the generated Random Forest (RF) models were age, FEV1%, and use of Ivacaftor/Tezacaftor. This is one of the few studies to assess adherence to CFTR modulators and symptomatic treatment longitudinally.

Diminished airway host innate response in people with cystic fibrosis who experience frequent pulmonary exacerbations.,"Rationale: Pulmonary exacerbations are clinically impactful events that accelerate cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease progression. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying an increased frequency of pulmonary exacerbations have not been explored.Objectives: To compare host immune response during intravenous antibiotic treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in people with CF who have a history of frequent *versus* infrequent exacerbations.Methods: Adults with CF were recruited at onset of antibiotic treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation and were categorised as infrequent or frequent exacerbators based on their pulmonary exacerbation frequency in the previous 12 months. Clinical parameters, sputum bacterial load and sputum inflammatory markers were measured on day 0, day 5 and at the end of treatment. Shotgun proteomic analysis was performed on sputum using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.Measurements and main results: Many sputum proteins were differentially enriched between infrequent and frequent exacerbators (day 0 n=23 and day 5 n=31). The majority of these proteins had a higher abundance in infrequent exacerbators and were secreted innate host defence proteins with antimicrobial, antiprotease and immunomodulatory functions. Several differentially enriched proteins were validated using ELISA and Western blot including secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), lipocalin-1 and cystatin SA. Sputum from frequent exacerbators demonstrated potent ability to cleave exogenous recombinant SLPI in a neutrophil elastase dependent manner. Frequent exacerbators had increased sputum inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-8) and total bacterial load compared to infrequent exacerbators.Conclusions: A diminished innate host protein defence may play a role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of frequent CF pulmonary exacerbations. Frequent exacerbators may benefit from therapies targeting this dysregulated host immune response.",38135443,PMC10882324,10.1183/13993003.01228-2023,,2024,"Houston CJ, Alkhatib A, Einarsson GG, Tunney MM, Taggart CC, Downey DG.",Y,MED
Nanoparticles as Drug Delivery Vehicles for People with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening, genetic disease that affects approximately 145,000 people worldwide. CF causes a dehydrated mucus layer in the lungs, leading to damaging infection and inflammation that eventually result in death. Nanoparticles (NPs), drug delivery vehicles intended for inhalation, have become a recent source of interest for treating CF and CF-related conditions, and many formulations have been created thus far. This paper is intended to provide an overview of CF and the effect it has on the lungs, the barriers in using NP drug delivery vehicles for treatment, and three common material class choices for these NP formulations: metals, polymers, and lipids. The materials to be discussed include gold, silver, and iron oxide metallic NPs; polyethylene glycol, chitosan, poly lactic-co-glycolic acid, and alginate polymeric NPs; and lipid-based NPs. The novelty of this review comes from a less specific focus on nanoparticle examples, with the focus instead being on the general theory behind material function, why or how a material might be used, and how it may be preferable to other materials used in treating CF. Finally, this paper ends with a short discussion of the two FDA-approved NPs for treatment of CF-related conditions and a recommendation for the future usage of NPs in people with Cystic Fibrosis (pwCF).",39329596,PMC11430251,10.3390/biomimetics9090574,,2024,"Hourihane E, Hixon KR.",Y,MED

A Comparative Analysis of Pricing and Reimbursement of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Modulators in Europe.,"**Objectives:** Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators, Kalydeco® (ivacaftor), Orkambi® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and Symkevi® (tezacaftor/ivacaftor), have substantially improved patients' lives yet significantly burden healthcare budgets. This analysis aims to compare pricing and reimbursement of aforementioned cystic fibrosis medicines, across European countries. **Methods:** Clinical trial registries, national databases, health technology assessment reports and grey literature of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Netherlands, the United Kingdom were consulted. Publicly available prices, reimbursement statuses, economic evaluations, budget impact analyses and managed entry agreements of CFTR modulators were examined. Results: In Belgium, lowest list prices were observed for Kalydeco® (ivacaftor) and Symkevi® (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) at €417 per defined daily dose (DDD) and €372 per average daily dose (ADD), respectively. Whereas, Switzerland had the lowest price for Orkambi® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) listed at €309 per DDD. Spain had the highest prices for Kalydeco® (ivacaftor) and Symkevi® (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) at €850 per DDD and €761 per ADD, whereas Orkambi® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) was most expensive in Poland at €983 per DDD. However, list prices were subject to confidential discounts and likely varied from actual costs. In all countries, these treatments were deemed not to be cost-effective. The annual budget impact of the CFTR modulators varied between countries and depended on factors such as local product prices, size of target population, scope of costs and discounting. However, all modulators were fully reimbursed in ten of the evaluated countries except for Sweden and Poland that, respectively, granted reimbursement to one and none of the therapies. Managed entry agreements were confidential but commonly adopted to address financial uncertainties. **Conclusion:** Discrepancies concerning prices, reimbursement and access were detected for Kalydeco® (ivacaftor), Orkambi® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and Symkevi® (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) across European countries.",34858177,PMC8630624,10.3389/fphar.2021.746710,,2021,"Abdallah K, De Boeck K, Dooms M, Simoens S.",Y,MED
Personalized Selection of a CFTR Modulator for a Patient with a Complex Allele [L467F;F508del].,"The presence of complex alleles in the CFTR gene can lead to difficulties in diagnosing cystic fibrosis and cause resistance to therapy with CFTR modulators. Tezacaftor/ivacaftor therapy for 8 months in a patient with the initially established F508del/F508del genotype did not lead to an improvement in her condition-there was no change in spirometry and an increase in the patient's weight, while there was only a slight decrease in NaCl values, measured by a sweat test. The intestinal current measurements of the patient's rectal biopsy showed no positive dynamics in the rescue of CFTR function while taking tezacaftor/ivacaftor. The assumption that the patient had an additional mutation in the cis position was confirmed by sequencing the *CFTR* gene, and the complex allele [L467F;F508del] was identified. Based on the rescue of CFTR function by elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor obtained using forskolin-induced swelling on intestinal organoids, the patient was prescribed therapy with this targeted drug. The use of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor for 7 months resulted in a significant improvement in the patient's clinical condition.",36286063,PMC9600521,10.3390/cimb44100349,,2022,"Kondratyeva E, Bulatenko N, Melyanovskaya Y, Efremova A, Zhekaite E, Sherman V, Voronkova A, Asherova I, Polyakov A, Adyan T, Kovalskaia V, Bukharova T, Goldshtein D, Kutsev S.",Y,MED

Parallel evolution of linezolid-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* in patients with cystic fibrosis.,"Linezolid is an antibiotic used to treat serious *Staphylococcus aureus* infections. Resistance to linezolid is considered rare but could emerge with repeated dosing. We recently reported widespread prescription of linezolid for a cohort of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The goals of this study were to determine the incidence of linezolid-resistant methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) in CF and identify molecular mechanisms for linezolid resistance. We identified patients who cultured *S. aureus* resistant to linezolid with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >4 at the University of Iowa CF Center between 2008 and 2018. We obtained isolates from these patients and retested susceptibility to linezolid using broth microdilution. We used whole genome sequencing to perform phylogenetic analysis of linezolid-resistant isolates and examine sequences for mutations or accessory genes that confer linezolid resistance. Between 2008 and 2018, 111 patients received linezolid, and 4 of these patients cultured linezolid-resistant *S. aureus*. We sequenced 11 resistant and 21 susceptible isolates from these 4 subjects. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that linezolid resistance developed in ST5 or ST105 backgrounds. Three individuals had linezolid-resistant *S. aureus* with a G2576T mutation in 23S rRNA. One of these subjects additionally had a *mutS- mutL-* hypermutating *S. aureus* that produced five resistant isolates with multiple ribosomal subunit mutations. In one subject, the genetic basis for linezolid resistance was unclear. We conclude that linezolid resistant *S. aureus* can occur through multiple genetic mechanisms in patients with repeated exposure to this antibiotic. IMPORTANCE Patients with cystic fibrosis have persistent lung infections with *Staphylococcus aureus* that require extensive antibiotic treatments. Linezolid, an antibiotic given by oral or intravenous route, is prescribed repeatedly for patients whose lung disease has progressed. After treatment with linezolid, *S. aureus* strains can evolve antibiotic resistance through multiple genetic mechanisms. In addition to a common mutation in the 23S ribosomal RNA known to confer linezolid resistance, *S. aureus* strains can evolve novel resistance based on a combination of mutations affecting the bacterial ribosome. This combination of mutations was observed in a strain that exhibited hypermutation owing to the loss of the DNA repair genes *mutS* and *mutL*. In this cohort of patients with cystic fibrosis, linezolid resistance was transient, possibly due to the growth disadvantage of resistant strains. However, ongoing chronic exposure to linezolid may create optimal conditions for the future emergence of resistance to this critical antibiotic.",37724867,PMC10581212,10.1128/spectrum.02084-23,,2023,"Pitcher NJ, Feder A, Bolden N, Zirbes CF, Pamatmat AJ, Boyken L, Hill JJ, Bartels AR, Thurman AL, Reeb VC, Porterfield HS, Moustafa AM, Planet PJ, Fischer AJ.",Y,MED
Coronary artery disease in patients with cystic fibrosis - A case series and review of the literature.,"Progressive obstructive pulmonary disease is the primary life-shortening complication in people with Cystic Fibrosis (CF); improvement in life expectancy has led to increased prevalence of non-pulmonary complications. Patients with CF are considered to be at low risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). We report here a case series of six patients with CF with and without known cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) who had acute myocardial infarction (AMI) requiring coronary stent placement. This was a heterogeneous group of patients, without a clear pattern of consistent risk factors. Interestingly, most patients in this cohort had low LDL. In this review, we discuss risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) that may apply to the CF population. While CAD is rare in people with CF, it does occur. We postulate that the risk will grow with increased longevity and the increased prevalence of co-morbidities such as obesity and dyslipidemia.",36267108,PMC9576554,10.1016/j.jcte.2022.100308,,2022,"Sandouk Z, Nachawi N, Simon R, Wyckoff J, Putman MS, Kiel S, Soltman S, Moran A, Moheet A.",Y,MED

Insights Into Patient Variability During Ivacaftor-Lumacaftor Therapy in Cystic Fibrosis.,"**Background:** The advent of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) modulators like ivacaftor have revolutionised the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). However, due to the plethora of variances in disease manifestations in CF, there are inherent challenges in unified responses under CFTR modulator treatment arising from variability in patient outcomes. The pharmacokinetic (PK) data available for ivacaftor-lumacaftor cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator drug combination is limited. **Methods:** Secondary objectives were to identify (1) patient characteristics and (2) the interactions between ivacaftor-lumacaftor responsible for interindividual variability (IIV). **Results:** Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of ivacaftor - lumacaftor were >10 fold lower than expected compared to label information. The one-way ANOVA indicated that the patient site had an effect on Cmax values of ivacaftor metabolites ivacaftor-M1, ivacaftor-M6, and lumacaftor (*p* < 0.001, *p* < 0.001, and *p* < 0.001, respectively). The Spearman's rho test indicated that patient weight and age have an effect on the Cmax of lumacaftor (*p* = 0.003 and *p* < 0.001, respectively) and ivacaftor metabolite M1 (*p* = 0.020 and *p* < 0.001, respectively). Age (*p* < 0.001) was found to effect on Cmax of ivacaftor M6 and on Tmax of ivacaftor M1 (*p* = 0.026). A large impact of patient characteristics on the IIV of PK parameters Cmax and Tmax, was observed among the CF patients. **Conclusion:** Understanding the many sources of variability can help reduce this individual patient variability and ensure consistent patient outcomes.",34408649,PMC8365608,10.3389/fphar.2021.577263,,2021,"Hanafin PO, Sermet-Gaudelus I, Griese M, Kappler M, Ellemunter H, Schwarz C, Wilson J, Tan M, Velkov T, Rao GG, Schneider-Futschik EK.",Y,MED
Lumacaftor/ivacaftor-associated health stabilisation in adults with severe cystic fibrosis.,"Introduction: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients homozygous for Phe508del with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) % pred >40%. We assessed the clinical utility of LUM/IVA in all eligible adult CF patients with FEV1 % pred <40% treated for at least 1 year under a single-centre managed access programme.Methods: Following clinical optimisation, eligible patients (n=40) with FEV1 % pred <40% were commenced on LUM/IVA and monitored for tolerance and clinical outcomes, including health service utilisation, pulmonary function, weight and body composition. 24 patients reached 1 year of treatment by the time of evaluation. Six patients discontinued due to adverse events (five for increased airways reactivity) and three underwent lung transplantation.Results: In comparison with the year prior to LUM/IVA commencement, significant reductions (median per year) were observed in the treatment year in the number of pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalisation (from 3 to 1.5; p=0.0002), hospitalisation days (from 27 to 17; p=0.0002) and intravenous antibiotic (IVAB) usage days (from 45 to 27; p=0.0007). Mean±sd change in FEV1 % pred was -2.10±1.18% per year in the year prior, with the decline reversed in the year following (+1.45±1.13% per year; p=0.035), although there was significant heterogeneity in individual responses. Mean±sd weight gain at 1 year was 2.5±4.1 kg (p=0.0007), comprising mainly fat mass (mean 2.2 kg). The proportion of patients severely underweight (body mass index <18.5 kg·m-2) decreased from 33% at baseline to 13% at 1 year (p=0.003).Conclusion: This real-world evaluation study demonstrated benefits over several clinical domains (infective exacerbations requiring hospitalisation, IVABs, pulmonary function decline and nutritional parameters) in CF patients with severe lung disease.",33569502,PMC7861032,10.1183/23120541.00203-2020,,2021,"King SJ, Keating D, Williams E, Paul E, Borg BM, Finlayson F, Button BM, Wilson JW, Kotsimbos T.",Y,MED
Pulmonary Exacerbations in Pediatric Patients: Retrospective Study in a Portuguese Cystic Fibrosis Center.,"(1) Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystemic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Lung disease, the leading cause of morbimortality, is marked by acute worsening of symptoms-such as pulmonary exacerbations (PEx). The objectives of this study were: Identifying the frequency of PEx in pediatric CF patients; Characterizing each PEx; Finding association between the frequency and characteristics of the PEx and patients' features. (2) Methods: Retrospective analysis of all PEx from a period of January 2015 to December 2019 in a group of pediatric patients from a single CF center. Data were collected from medical records. Descriptive statistics and chi-square/Fisher's test were used. (3) Results: Thirty-four pediatric patients contributed to the total sample used in this study and 198 PEx were identified, median of 1.0 PEx/patient/year. Most frequent PEx symptoms were increased cough (93.9%) and change in secretions (88.4%), most common pathogens were *Staphylococcus aureus* (54.9%) and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (24.9%). The majority were treated as outpatient (85.9%). Most common antibiotics included amoxicillin/clavulanate (35.9%) and ciprofloxacin (22.7%). Outcome was favorable in all PEx. (4) Conclusion: Results were consistent with what has been described in literature. More studies are necessary for a better characterization of CF PEx, in order to develop standardized protocols for their management.",35204878,PMC8869878,10.3390/children9020157,,2022,"Cardoso R, Cardoso AL, Barbosa T.",Y,MED
CFTR Function Restoration upon Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor Treatment in Patient-Derived Intestinal Organoids with Rare *CFTR* Genotypes.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the *Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator* (*CFTR*) gene. The combination of the CFTR modulators elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor (ETI) enables the effective rescue of CFTR function in people with the most prevalent F508del mutation. However, the functional restoration of rare *CFTR* variants remains unclear. Here, we use patient-derived intestinal organoids (PDIOs) to identify rare *CFTR* variants and potentially individuals with CF that might benefit from ETI. First, steady-state lumen area (SLA) measurements were taken to assess CFTR function and compare it to the level observed in healthy controls. Secondly, the forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) assay was performed to measure CFTR rescue within a lower function range, and to further compare it to ETI-mediated CFTR rescue in CFTR genotypes that have received market approval. ETI responses in 30 PDIOs harboring the F508del mutation served as reference for ETI responses of 22 PDIOs with genotypes that are not currently eligible for CFTR modulator treatment, following European Medicine Agency (EMA) and/or U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. Our data expand previous datasets showing a correlation between in vitro CFTR rescue in organoids and corresponding in vivo ppFEV1 improvement upon a CFTR modulator treatment in published clinical trials, and suggests that the majority of individuals with rare *CFTR* variants could benefit from ETI. CFTR restoration was further confirmed on protein levels using Western blot. Our data support that CFTR function measurements in PDIOs with rare *CFTR* genotypes can help to select potential responders to ETI, and suggest that regulatory authorities need to consider providing access to treatment based on the principle of equality for people with CF who do not have access to treatment.",37833986,PMC10572896,10.3390/ijms241914539,,2023,"Lefferts JW, Bierlaagh MC, Kroes S, Nieuwenhuijze NDA, Sonneveld van Kooten HN, Niemöller PJ, Verburg TF, Janssens HM, Muilwijk D, van Beuningen SFB, van der Ent CK, Beekman JM.",Y,MED
The Role of MMPs in the Era of CFTR Modulators: An Additional Target for Cystic Fibrosis Patients?,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a high-prevalence disease characterized by significant lung remodeling, responsible for high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The lung structural changes are partly due to proteolytic activity associated with inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are the major proteases involved in CF, and recent literature data focused on their potential role in the pathogenesis of the disease. In fact, an imbalance of proteases and antiproteases was observed in CF patients, resulting in dysfunction of protease activity and loss of lung homeostasis. Currently, many steps forward have been moved in the field of pharmacological treatment with the recent introduction of triple-combination therapy targeting the CFTR channel. Despite CFTR modulator therapy potentially being effective in up to 90% of patients with CF, there are still patients who are not eligible for the available therapies. Here, we introduce experimental drugs to provide updates on therapy evolution regarding a proportion of CF non-responder patients to current treatment, and we summarize the role of MMPs in pathogenesis and as future therapeutic targets of CF.",36830719,PMC9952876,10.3390/biom13020350,,2023,"Esposito R, Mirra D, Spaziano G, Panico F, Gallelli L, D'Agostino B.",Y,MED
CFTR Modulator Therapy and Its Impact on Lung Transplantation in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasian people and is caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. It is a multisystem disorder; however, CF lung disease causes most of its morbidity and mortality. Although survival for CF has improved over time due to a multifaceted symptomatic management approach, CF remains a life-limiting disease. For individuals with progressive advanced CF lung disease (ACFLD), lung transplantation is considered the ultimate treatment option if compatible with goals of care. Since 2012, newer drugs, called CFTR modulators, have gradually become available, revolutionizing CF care, as these small-molecule drugs target the underlying defect in CF that causes decreased CFTR protein synthesis, function, or stability. Because of their extremely high efficacy and overall respectable tolerability, CFTR modulator drugs have already proven to have a substantial positive impact on the lives of individuals with CF. Individuals with ACFLD have generally been excluded from initial clinical trials. Now, however, these drugs are being used in clinical practice in selected individuals with ACFLD, showing promising results, although randomized controlled trial data for CFTR modulators in this subgroup of patients are lacking. Such data need to be gathered, ideally in randomized controlled trials including patients with ACFLD. Furthermore, the efficacy and tolerability of the newer modulator therapies in individuals with ACFLD need to be monitored, and their impact on lung disease progression and the need for lung transplantation as the ultimate therapy call for an objective evaluation in larger patient cohorts. As of today, guidelines for referral and listing of lung transplant candidates with CF have not incorporated the status of the new CFTR modulator therapies in the referral and listing process. The purpose of this review article, therefore, is threefold: first, to describe the effects of new therapies, with a focus on the subgroup of individuals with ACFLD; second, to provide an update on the recent outcomes after lung transplantation for individuals with CF; and third, to discuss the referral, evaluation, and timing for lung transplantation as the ultimate therapeutic option in view of the new treatments available in CF.",34406641,PMC8589902,10.1007/s41030-021-00170-9,,2021,"Benden C, Schwarz C.",Y,MED
Malassezia Folliculitis following Triple Therapy for Cystic Fibrosis.,"Triple-combination therapy with elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor has been recently approved for cystic fibrosis patients with at least one F508*del* mutation in the transmembrane conductance regulator of the cystic fibrosis gene. Among the adverse events of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, the cutaneous ones have been rarely reported, mainly dealing with urticarial-like rashes. On this topic, we report two cases of Malassezia folliculitis following triple therapy administration in two young females. In the first patient, a papulopustular rush appeared before the folliculitis while in the second patient it was not preceded by other skin manifestations. The diagnosis was confirmed both by dermoscopy and histology. The prompt response to systemic antimycotic drugs provided further evidence for the causative role of Malassezia, requiring no discontinuation of cystic fibrosis therapy. We could hypothesize that the triple regimen treatment may induce changes in the skin microbiome, potentially able to favor colonization and proliferation of Malassezia species. Physicians should be aware of such associations to allow prompt diagnosis and early interventions, avoiding useless drug removal.",36143881,PMC9503821,10.3390/medicina58091204,,2022,"Li Pomi F, Di Bartolomeo L, Vaccaro M, Lentini M, Cristadoro S, Lucanto MC, Lombardo M, Costa S, Borgia F.",Y,MED
Obesity in cystic fibrosis.,"The prevalence of obesity in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is increasing and around one-third of adults with CF are now overweight or obese. The causes of excess weight gain in CF are likely multifactorial, including: adherence to the high-fat legacy diet, reduced exercise tolerance, therapeutic advances, and general population trends. Increased weight has generally been considered favorable in CF, correlating with improved pulmonary function and survival. While the optimal BMI for overall health in CF is unknown, most studies demonstrate minimal improvement in pulmonary function when BMI exceeds 30 kg/m2. Dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease are important co-morbidities of obesity in the general population, but are uncommon in CF. In people with CF, obesity is associated with hypertension and higher cholesterol levels. With longer life expectancy and rising obesity rates, there may be an increase in cardiovascular disease among people with CF in coming years. Overweight CF patients are more likely to be insulin resistant, taking on features of type 2 diabetes. Treating obesity in people with CF requires carefully weighing the metabolic risks of overnutrition with the impact of low or falling BMI on lung function. This article describes current knowledge on the epidemiology, causes, consequence, and treatment of obesity in people with CF.",34868883,PMC8626670,10.1016/j.jcte.2021.100276,,2021,"Kutney KA, Sandouk Z, Desimone M, Moheet A.",Y,MED
Computed Tomographic Changes in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis Treated by Combination Therapy with Lumacaftor and Ivacaftor.,"Background: As Cystic Fibrosis (CF) treatments drastically improved in recent years, tools to assess their efficiency need to be properly evaluated, especially cross-sectional imaging techniques. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan response to combined lumacaftor- ivacaftor therapy (Orkambi®) in patients with homozygous for F508del CFTR has not yet been assessed.Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study in two French reference centers in CF in Marseille hospitals, including teenagers (>12 years old) and adults (>18 years) who had received lumacaftor-ivacaftor and for whom we had at disposal at least two CT scans, one at before therapy and one at least six months after therapy start. CT scoring was performed by using the modified version of the Brody score.Results: 34 patients have been included. The mean age was 26 years (12-56 years). There was a significant decrease in the total CT score (65.5 to 60.3, *p* = 0.049) and mucous plugging subscore (12.3 to 8.7, *p* = 0.009). Peribronchial wall thickening (PWT) was significantly improved only in the adult group (29.1 to 27.0, *p* = 0.04). Improvements in total score, peribronchial thickening, and mucous pluggings were significantly correlated with improvement in FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 s).Conclusions: Treatment with lumacaftor-ivacaftor was associated with a significant improvement in the total CT score, which was mainly related to an improvement in mucous pluggings.",34066942,PMC8124862,10.3390/jcm10091999,,2021,"Arnaud F, Stremler-Le Bel N, Reynaud-Gaubert M, Mancini J, Gaubert JY, Gorincour G.",Y,MED

Lumacaftor/ivacaftor changes the lung microbiome and metabolome in cystic fibrosis patients.,"Rationale: Targeted cystic fibrosis (CF) therapy with lumacaftor/ivacaftor partly restores chloride channel function and improves epithelial fluid transport in the airways. Consequently, changes may occur in the microbiome, which is adapted to CF lungs.Objectives: To investigate the effects of lumacaftor/ivacaftor on respiratory microbial composition and microbial metabolic activity by repeatedly sampling the lower respiratory tract.Methods: This was a single-centre longitudinal observational cohort study in adult CF patients with a homozygous Phe508del mutation. Lung function measurements and microbial cultures of sputum were performed as part of routine care. An oral and nasal wash, and a breath sample, were collected before and every 3 months after starting therapy, for up to 12 months.Results: Twenty patients were included in this study. Amplicon 16S RNA and metagenomics sequencing revealed that *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* was most abundant in sputum and seemed to decrease after 6 months of treatment, although this did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple testing. Two types of untargeted metabolomics analyses in sputum showed a change in metabolic composition between 3 and 9 months that almost returned to baseline levels after 12 months of treatment. The volatile metabolic composition of breath was significantly different after 3 months and remained different from baseline until 12 months follow-up.Conclusions: After starting CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulating treatment in CF patients with a homozygous Phe508del mutation, a temporary and moderate change in the lung microbiome is observed, which is mainly characterised by a reduction in the relative abundance of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.",33898610,PMC8053817,10.1183/23120541.00731-2020,,2021,"Neerincx AH, Whiteson K, Phan JL, Brinkman P, Abdel-Aziz MI, Weersink EJM, Altenburg J, Majoor CJ, Maitland-van der Zee AH, Bos LDJ.",Y,MED
Losartan ameliorates TGF-β1-induced CFTR dysfunction and improves correction by cystic fibrosis modulator therapies.,"Highly effective modulator therapies dramatically improve the prognosis for those with cystic fibrosis (CF). The triple combination of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor (ETI) benefits many, but not all, of those with the most common F508del mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Here, we showed that poor sweat chloride concentration responses and lung function improvements upon initiation of ETI were associated with elevated levels of active TGF-β1 in the upper airway. Furthermore, TGF-β1 impaired the function of ETI-corrected F508del-CFTR, thereby increasing airway surface liquid (ASL) absorption rates and inducing mucus hyperconcentration in primary CF bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. TGF-β1 not only decreased CFTR mRNA, but was also associated with increases in the mRNA expression of TNFA and COX2 and TNF-α protein. Losartan improved TGF-β1-mediated inhibition of ETI-corrected F508del-CFTR function and reduced TNFA and COX2 mRNA and TNF-α protein expression. This likely occurred by improving correction of mutant CFTR rather than increasing its mRNA (without an effect on potentiation), thereby reversing the negative effects of TGF-β1 and improving ASL hydration in the CF airway epithelium in vitro. Importantly, these effects were independent of type 1 angiotensin II receptor inhibition.",35446787,PMC9151698,10.1172/jci155241,,2022,"Kim MD, Bengtson CD, Yoshida M, Niloy AJ, Dennis JS, Baumlin N, Salathe M.",Y,MED
"Effects of a Partially Supervised Conditioning Program in Cystic Fibrosis: An International Multicenter, Randomized Controlled Trial (ACTIVATE-CF).","**Rationale:** The long-term effects of vigorous physical activity (PA) on lung function in cystic fibrosis are unclear. **Objectives:** To evaluate effects of a 12-month partially supervised PA intervention using motivational feedback. **Methods:** In a parallel-arm multicenter randomized controlled trial (ACTIVATE-CF), relatively inactive patients aged at least 12 years were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to an intervention group or control group. The intervention group consented to add 3 hours of vigorous PA per week, whereas the control group was asked not to change their PA behavior. Primary endpoint was change in percent predicted FEV1 (ΔFEV1) at 6 months. Secondary endpoints included PA, exercise capacity, exercise motives, time to first exacerbation and exacerbation rates, quality of life, anxiety, depression, stress, and blood glucose control. Data were analyzed using mixed linear models. **Measurements and Main Results:** A total of 117 patients (40% of target sample size) were randomized to an intervention (n = 60) or control group (n = 57). After 6 months, ΔFEV1 was significantly higher in the control group compared with the intervention group (2.70% predicted [95% confidence interval, 0.13-5.26]; *P* = 0.04). The intervention group reported increased vigorous PA compared with the control group at each study visit, had higher exercise capacity at 6 and 12 months, and higher PA at 12 months.

Elexacaftor Mediates the Rescue of F508del CFTR Functional Expression Interacting with MSD2.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most frequent lethal autosomal recessive diseases affecting the Caucasian population. It is caused by loss of function variants of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a membrane protein located on the apical side of epithelial cells. The most prevalent CF-causing mutation, the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del), is characterized by folding and trafficking defects, resulting in the decreased functional expression of the protein on the plasma membrane. Two classes of small-molecule modulators, termed potentiators and correctors, respectively, have been developed to rescue either the gating or the cellular processing of defective F508del CFTR. Kaftrio, a next-generation triple-combination drug, consisting of the potentiator ivacaftor (VX770) and the two correctors tezacaftor (VX661) and elexacaftor (VX445), has been demonstrated to be a life-changing therapeutic modality for the majority of people with CF worldwide. While the mechanism of action of VX770 and VX661 is almost known, the precise mechanism of action and binding site of VX445 have not been conclusively determined. We investigated the activity of VX445 on mutant F508del to identify the protein domains whose expression is mostly affected by this corrector and to disclose its mechanisms of action. Our biochemical analyses revealed that VX445 specifically improves the expression and the maturation of MSD2, heterologously expressed in HEK 293 cells, and confirmed that its effect on the functional expression of defective F508del CFTR is additive either with type I or type II CFTR correctors. We are confident that our study will help to make a step forward in the comprehension of the etiopathology of the CF disease, as well as to give new information for the development and testing of combinations of even more effective correctors able to target mutation-specific defects of the CFTR protein.",37629017,PMC10454486,10.3390/ijms241612838,,2023,"Bongiorno R, Ludovico A, Moran O, Baroni D.",Y,MED

However, the current first-line approach based mainly on pulmonary function to measure effects of the novel therapy, tested by forced expiratory volumes in one second (FEV1), provides restricted sensitivity to detect early structural damages. Accordingly, there is a need for new sensitive surrogate parameters. Most interestingly, these should quantify inflammation that precedes a decline of pulmonary function. We present a novel method assessing inflammatory markers in the upper airways' epithelial lining fluid (ELF) obtained by nasal lavage (NL). In contrast to broncho-alveolar lavage, ELF sampling by NL is an attractive method due to its limited invasiveness which allows repeated analyses, even performed in a home-based setting. In a longitudinal cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT02311140), we assessed changes of inflammatory mediators in 259 serially obtained nasal lavages taken up to every second day before and during therapy with ivacaftor from ten CF patients carrying a G551D mutation. Patients were trained to sample NL-fluid at home, to immediately freeze and transfer chilled secretions to centers. Neutrophil Elastase, Interleukins IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 in NL were quantified. During 8-12 weeks of ivacaftor-treatment, median values of IL-1β and IL-6 significantly declined 2.29-fold (2.97→1.30 pg/mL), and 1.13-fold (6.48→5.72 pg/mL), respectively. In parallel, sweat tests and pulmonary function improved considerably. This is the first study assessing changes of airway inflammation on a day-to-day basis in CF patients receiving a newly administered CFTR-modulator therapy. It proves a decline of airway inflammation during ivacaftor-therapy.",34025651,PMC8131546,10.3389/fimmu.2021.642180,,2021,"Mainz JG, Arnold C, Wittstock K, Hipler UC, Lehmann T, Zagoya C, Duckstein F, Ellemunter H, Hentschel J.",Y,MED
"Short-term effects of Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor (Orkambi™) on exertional symptoms, exercise performance, and ventilatory responses in adults with cystic fibrosis.","Rationale: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) modestly improves lung function following 1 month of treatment but it is unknown if this translates into improvements in exercise endurance and exertional symptoms.Methods: Adult CF participants completed a symptom-limited constant load cycling test with simultaneous assessments of dyspnea and leg discomfort ratings pre- and 1 month post-initiation of LUM/IVA.Results: Endurance time, exertional dyspnea and leg discomfort ratings at submaximal exercise did not change significantly. There was a significant inverse correlation between changes in leg discomfort and endurance time (r = - 0.88; p = 0.009) following 1-month of LUM/IVA.Conclusions: Overall, 1-month of LUM/IVA did not increase endurance time or modify exertional dyspnea or leg discomfort ratings. However, individuals who experienced a reduction in leg discomfort following LUM/IVA had an improvement in endurance time. Future studies with a larger sample size are needed to verify these findings and to assess the long-term effects of LUM/IVA on exercise outcomes.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02821130.

Clinical outcomes of adults and children with cystic fibrosis during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Background: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with restricted community movement and limited access to healthcare facilities, resulting in changed clinical service delivery to people with cystic fibrosis (CF). This study aimed to determine clinical outcomes of Australian adults and children with CF in the 12-months following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: This longitudinal cohort study used national registry data. Primary outcomes were 12-month change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1 %pred), body mass index (BMI) in adults and BMI z-scores in children. A piecewise linear mixed-effects model was used to determine trends in outcomes before and after pandemic onset.Results: Data were available for 3662 individuals (median age 19.6 years, range 0-82). When trends in outcomes before and after pandemic onset were compared; FEV1 %pred went from a mean annual decline of -0.13% (95%CI -0.36 to 0.11) to a mean improvement of 1.76% (95%CI 1.46-2.05). Annual trend in BMI improved from 0.03 kg/m2 (95%CI -0.02-0.08) to 0.30 kg/m2 (95%CI 0.25-0.45) and BMI z-scores improved from 0.05 (95%CI 0.03-0.07) to 0.12 (95%CI 0.09-0.14). Number of hospitalisations decreased from a total of 2656 to 1957 (p < 0.01). Virtual consultations increased from 8% to 47% and average number of consultations per patient increased from median (IQR) of 4(2-5) to 5(3-6) (p < 0.01).Conclusion: In the 12-months following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an improvement in the clinical outcomes of people with CF when compared to the pre-pandemic period.",36163166,PMC9477965,10.1016/j.jcf.2022.09.006,,2023,"Doumit M, Chuang S, Middleton P, Selvadurai H, Sivam S, Ruseckaite R, Ahern S, Mallitt KA, Pacey V, Gray K, Jaffe A.",Y,MED
"Diagnosis, Management, and Prognosis of Cystic Fibrosis-Related Liver Disease in Children.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multifaceted disorder predominantly investigated for its pulmonary manifestations, yet patients with CF also exhibit a spectrum of extrapulmonary manifestations, notably those involving the hepatobiliary system. The latter constitutes the third leading cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with CF. Cystic fibrosis-related liver disease (CFLD), with an escalating prevalence, manifests diverse clinical presentations ranging from hepatomegaly to cirrhosis and hepatopulmonary syndrome. Consequently, early detection and appropriate management are imperative for sustaining the health and influencing the quality of life of CF patients afflicted with CFLD. This review aims to consolidate existing knowledge by providing a comprehensive overview of hepatobiliary manifestations associated with CF. It delineates the clinical hepatobiliary manifestations, diagnostic methodologies, incorporating minimally invasive markers, and therapeutic approaches, encompassing the impact of novel CFTR modulators on CFLD. Given the exigency of early diagnosis and the intricate management of CFLD, a multidisciplinary team approach is essential to optimize care and enhance the quality of life for this subset of patients. In conclusion, recognizing CF as more than solely a pulmonary ailment, the authors underscore the imperative for further clinical investigations to establish a more robust evidence base for CFLD management within the continuum of this chronic disease.",38473009,PMC10930689,10.3390/diagnostics14050538,,2024,"Anton-Păduraru DT, Azoicăi AN, Trofin F, Murgu AM, Mîndru DE, Bocec AS, Halițchi COI, Zota GR, Păduraru D, Nastase EV.",Y,MED
CFTR is required for zinc-mediated antibacterial defense in human macrophages.,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion transporter required for epithelial homeostasis in the lung and other organs, with *CFTR* mutations leading to the autosomal recessive genetic disease CF. Apart from excessive mucus accumulation and dysregulated inflammation in the airways, people with CF (pwCF) exhibit defective innate immune responses and are susceptible to bacterial respiratory pathogens such as *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. Here, we investigated the role of CFTR in macrophage antimicrobial responses, including the zinc toxicity response that is used by these innate immune cells against intracellular bacteria. Using both pharmacological approaches, as well as cells derived from pwCF, we show that CFTR is required for uptake and clearance of pathogenic *Escherichia coli* by CSF-1-derived primary human macrophages. CFTR was also required for *E. coli*-induced zinc accumulation and zinc vesicle formation in these cells, and *E*. *coli* residing in macrophages exhibited reduced zinc stress in the absence of CFTR function. Accordingly, CFTR was essential for reducing the intramacrophage survival of a zinc-sensitive *E. coli* mutant compared to wild-type *E. coli*. Ectopic expression of the zinc transporter SLC30A1 or treatment with exogenous zinc was sufficient to restore antimicrobial responses against *E*. *coli* in human macrophages. Zinc supplementation also restored bacterial killing in GM-CSF-derived primary human macrophages responding to *P. aeruginosa*, used as an in vitro macrophage model relevant to CF. Thus, restoration of the zinc toxicity response could be pursued as a therapeutic strategy to restore innate immune function and effective host defense in pwCF.",38363865,PMC10895263,10.1073/pnas.2315190121,,2024,"Das Gupta K, Curson JEB, Tarique AA, Kapetanovic R, Schembri MA, Fantino E, Sly PD, Sweet MJ.",Y,MED
Adherence to cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators: analysis of a national specialty pharmacy database.,"Background: There have been significant advances in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) treatment, with the introduction of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) modulators. Adherence is an important goal for CF management, as nonadherence is linked to poor health outcomes.Objective: To calculate the medication adherence in patients taking CFTR modulators using a national specialty pharmacy database.Methods: This retrospective observational cohort study utilized de-identified specialty pharmacy data from September 2017 to August 2018 to assess medication adherence for three CFTR modulators: ivacaftor, lumacaftor/ivacaftor, and tezacaftor/ivacaftor & ivacaftor. The primary outcome was proportion of days covered (PDC) for each medication, with mean PDC values compared across age groups and insurance characteristics. All analyses were performed using the SAS 9.4 University Edition (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).Results: A total of 2,548 patients were analyzed, including 1,289 (50.59%) patients on lumacaftor/ivacaftor, 784 (30.77%) on ivacaftor, and 475 (18.64%) on tezacaftor/ivacaftor & ivacaftor. The mean PDC value for all CFTR modulators was above 0.80. Tezacaftor/ivacaftor & ivacaftor had the highest overall PDC of 0.92, while PDC values for both lumacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor were 0.84. Children/adolescents on lumacaftor/ivacaftor (*p* = 0.0001) and tezacaftor/ivacaftor & ivacaftor (*p* = 0.001) had significantly higher mean PDC values compared to adults but not for ivacaftor (*p* = 0.3744). No statistical differences were seen in PDC across insurance characteristics.Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the adherence of three CFTR modulators using a large nationwide specialty database. With high acquisition costs of CFTR modulator therapies, there is a need to improve rates of adherence in patients with CF.",33968464,PMC8078929,10.1080/21556660.2021.1912352,,2021,"Mehta Z, Kamal KM, Miller R, Covvey JR, Giannetti V.",Y,MED
Persistent Aspergillus fumigatus infection in cystic fibrosis: impact on lung function and role of treatment of asymptomatic colonization-a registry-based case-control study.,"Background: Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common filamentous fungus isolated from the airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). The aim of this study was to investigate how chronic A. fumigatus colonization affects lung function in people with CF, to identify risk factors for colonization, and to evaluate antifungal treatment of asymptomatic Aspergillus colonization.Methods: Data from 2014-2018 was collected from the Swedish CF registry and medical records. Baseline data before the start of A. fumigatus colonization was compared with the two succeeding years to evaluate how colonization and treatment affected lung function and other clinical aspects.Results: A total of 437 patients were included, of which 64 (14.6%) became colonized with A. fumigatus during the study period. Inhaled antibiotics was associated with A. fumigatus colonization (adjusted OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.6-5.9, p < 0.05). Fungal colonization was not associated with a more rapid lung function decline or increased use of IV-antibiotics compared to the non-colonized group, but patients with A. fumigatus had more hospital days, a higher increase of total IgE, and higher eosinophil counts. In the Aspergillus group, 42 patients were considered to be asymptomatic. Of these, 19 patients received antifungal treatment. Over the follow up period, the treated group had a more pronounced decrease in percent predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (ppFEV1) compared to untreated patients (- 8.7 vs - 1.4 percentage points, p < 0.05).Conclusion: Inhaled antibiotics was associated with A. fumigatus colonization, but no association was found between persistent A. fumigatus and subsequent lung function decline. No obvious benefits of treating asymptomatic A. fumigatus colonization were demonstrated.",35790954,PMC9258124,10.1186/s12890-022-02054-3,,2022,"Blomquist A, Inghammar M, Al Shakirchi M, Ericson P, Krantz C, Svedberg M, Lindblad A, Påhlman LI.",Y,MED
Real-World Outcomes in Cystic Fibrosis Telemedicine Clinical Care in a Time of a Global Pandemic.,"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the University of Virginia adult cystic fibrosis (CF) center transitioned from in-person clinical encounters to a model that included interdisciplinary telemedicine. The pandemic presented an unprecedented opportunity to assess the impact of the interdisciplinary telemedicine model on clinical CF outcomes.Research question: What are the clinical outcomes of a care model that includes interdisciplinary telemedicine (IDC-TM) compared with in-person clinical care for patients with CF during the COVID-19 pandemic?Study design and methods: Adults with CF were included. The prepandemic year was defined as March 17, 2019, through March 16, 2020, and the pandemic year (PY) was defined as March 17, 2020, through March 16, 2021. Patients were enrolled starting in the PY. Prepandemic data were gathered retrospectively. Telemedicine visits were defined as clinical encounters via secured video communication. Hybrid visits were in-person evaluations by physician, with in-clinic video communication by other team members. In-person visits were encounters with in-person providers only. All encounters included previsit screening. Outcomes were lung function, BMI, exacerbations, and antibiotic use. FEV1 percent predicted, exacerbations, and antibiotic use were adjusted for the effect of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor treatment.Results: One hundred twenty-four patients participated. One hundred ten patients were analyzed (mean age, 35 years; range, 18-69 years). Ninety-five percent had access to telemedicine (n = 105). Telemedicine visits accounted for 64% of encounters (n = 260), hybrid visits with telemedicine support accounted for 28% of encounters (n = 114), and in-person visits accounted for 7% of encounters (n = 30). No difference in lung function or exacerbation rate during the PY was found. BMI increased from 25 to 26 kg/m2 (t100 = -4.72; P < .001). Antibiotic use decreased from 316 to 124 episodes (z = 8.81; P < .0001).Interpretation: This CF care model, which includes IDC-TM, successfully monitored lung function and BMI, identified exacerbations, and followed guidelines-based care during the pandemic. A significant decrease in antibiotic use suggests that social mitigation strategies were protective.Trial registry: ClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT04402801; URL: www.Clinicaltrials: gov.",34896356,PMC8660127,10.1016/j.chest.2021.11.035,,2022,"Somerville LAL, List RP, Compton MH, Bruschwein HM, Jennings D, Jones MK, Murray RK, Starheim ER, Webb KM, Gettle LS, Albon DP.",Y,MED
DNA Methylation at *ATP11A* cg11702988 Is a Biomarker of Lung Disease Severity in Cystic Fibrosis: A Longitudinal Study.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic genetic disease that mainly affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. No curative treatments are available, but the follow-up in specialized centers has greatly improved the patient life expectancy. Robust biomarkers are required to monitor the disease, guide treatments, stratify patients, and provide outcome measures in clinical trials. In the present study, we outline a strategy to select putative DNA methylation biomarkers of lung disease severity in cystic fibrosis patients. In the discovery step, we selected seven potential biomarkers using a genome-wide DNA methylation dataset that we generated in nasal epithelial samples from the MethylCF cohort. In the replication step, we assessed the same biomarkers using sputum cell samples from the MethylBiomark cohort. Of interest, DNA methylation at the cg11702988 site (*ATP11A* gene) positively correlated with lung function and BMI, and negatively correlated with lung disease severity, *P. aeruginosa* chronic infection, and the number of exacerbations. These results were replicated in prospective sputum samples collected at four time points within an 18-month period and longitudinally. To conclude, (i) we identified a DNA methylation biomarker that correlates with CF severity, (ii) we provided a method to easily assess this biomarker, and (iii) we carried out the first longitudinal analysis of DNA methylation in CF patients. This new epigenetic biomarker could be used to stratify CF patients in clinical trials.",33808877,PMC8003783,10.3390/genes12030441,,2021,"Pineau F, Caimmi D, Taviaux S, Reveil M, Brosseau L, Rivals I, Drevait M, Vachier I, Claustres M, Chiron R, De Sario A.",Y,MED
A new era for people with cystic fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis is the most prevalent inherited disease caused by a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The impaired electrolyte homeostasis caused by the mutated or absent protein leads to symptoms in multiple organ systems. However, the pulmonary manifestation with chronic infections and eventually respiratory failure remains the most important threat. Until one decade ago, only symptomatic treatment was available. However, since 2012, different combinations of CFTR modulators are available for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) that carry different mutations. The advent of these drugs has impressively changed life expectancy and quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis and raised new challenges regarding long-term complications and tapering of conventional therapies.Conclusion: In this review, we provide an update on the latest developments around diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of pwCF. What is Known: • Cystic fibrosis is an incurable and life-shortening disease asking for life-long symptomatic treatment. • Three combination CFTR modulating drugs has gained marked approval over the last 10 years. What is New: • The emerge of new (modulating) therapies contribute to the increasing life expectancy. • A high unmet need to develop new therapies for people with CF who cannot access or benefit from these drugs remains. This review gives an update on the current status.",34213646,PMC8346380,10.1007/s00431-021-04168-y,,2021,"Bierlaagh MC, Muilwijk D, Beekman JM, van der Ent CK.",Y,MED
"Assessing the health risk of living near composting facilities on lung health, fungal and bacterial disease in cystic fibrosis: a UK CF Registry study.","Aim: To explore the health risk of living near permitted composting sites (PCSs) on disease severity in children and adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) across the UK. METHODS: A semi-individual cross-sectional study was used to examine the risk of disease severity in people with CF (pwCF) within and beyond 4 km of PCSs in the UK in 2016. All pwCF registered in the UK CF Registry were eligible for this study. Linear and Poisson regressions, adjusted for age, gender, genotype, BMI, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and deprivation, were used to quantify associations between distance to a PCS and percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1), pulmonary exacerbations (#IVdays), and fungal and bacterial infections.Results: The mean age of the 9,361 pwCF (3,931 children and 5,430 adults) studied was 20.1 (SD = 14.1) years; 53.3% were male; and 49.2% were homozygous F508del. Over 10% of pwCF (n = 1,015) lived within 4 km of a PCS. We found no statistically significant difference in ppFEV1 and #IVdays/year in children. However, in adults, ppFEV1 was -1.07% lower (95% confidence interval (CI): -2.29%, 0.16%) and #IVdays/year were 1.02 day higher (95%CI: 1.01, 1.04) within 4 km of a PCS. Furthermore, there were statistically significant differences in mean ppFEV1 in CF adults with Aspergillus fumigatus (58.2.% vs 62.0%, p = 0.005) and Candida spp. (56.9% vs 59.9%, p = 0.029) residing within 4 km of a PCS. No associations were identified for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, P. aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus.Conclusions: This novel national study provides evidence that adults with CF living near a PCS may experience small reductions in lung function, an increased risk of pulmonary exacerbations, and more frequent fungal infections. If confirmed by studies using refined exposure assessment methods accounting for bioaerosol dispersion, these results could have important implications for the living environment of pwCF.",36517903,PMC9753251,10.1186/s12940-022-00932-1,,2022,"Khan MS, Douglas P, Hansell AL, Simmonds NJ, Piel FB.",Y,MED
Effectiveness of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor Therapy in Three Subjects with the Cystic Fibrosis Genotype Phe508del/Unknown and Advanced Lung Disease.,"We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) in three subjects carrying the *Phe508del*/unknown CFTR genotype. An ex vivo analysis on nasal epithelial cells (NEC) indicated a significant improvement of CFTR gating activity after the treatment. Three patients were enrolled in an ELX/TEZ/IVA managed-access program, including subjects with the highest percent predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in the 1st second (ppFEV1) < 40 in the preceding 3 months. Data were collected at baseline and after 8, 12 and 24 weeks of follow-up during treatment. All patients showed a considerable decrease of sweat chloride (i.e., meanly about 60 mmol/L as compared to baseline), relevant improvement of ppFEV1 (i.e., >8) and six-minute walk test, and an increase in body mass index after the first 8 weeks of treatment. No pulmonary exacerbations occurred during the 24 weeks of treatment and all domains of the CF Questionnaire-Revised improved. No safety concerns related to the treatment occurred. This study demonstrates the benefit from the ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment in patients with CF with the *Phe508del* and one unidentified CFTR variant. The preliminary ex vivo analysis of the drug response on NEC helps to predict the in vivo therapeutic endpoints.",34440351,PMC8391133,10.3390/genes12081178,,2021,"Terlizzi V, Colangelo C, Marsicovetere G, D'Andria M, Francalanci M, Innocenti D, Masi E, Avarello A, Taccetti G, Amato F, Comegna M, Castaldo G, Salvatore D.",Y,MED
Gender-affirming hormone therapy in cystic fibrosis - A case of new Pseudomonas infection.,"Background: Little is known about the impact of hormone therapy on transgender youth with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). This case report describes an 18-year-old affirmed female with CF who was treated with hormone therapy associated in timing with new growth of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* in her sputum culture.Discussion: We highlight important considerations, including the impact of gender-affirming hormone therapy on overall CF disease course. Evidence supports that females with CF have worse outcomes than males, which are partly attributed to estrogen effects. *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is one of the most prevalent pathogens in people with CF. Here, we highlight a transfemale who grows *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* for the first time since her youth, nearly 1 year after starting estrogen therapy. This is consistent with previous literature of an association between high estrogen levels and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* prevalence, but has never been evaluated in a transgender population.Conclusion: Through this case, we demonstrate the need for additional research to understand the relationship between gender-affirmative hormone transition and CF care and management.",33537203,PMC7841348,10.1016/j.rmcr.2021.101353,,2021,"Shaffer L, Bozkanat K, Lau M, Sharma P, Sathe M, Lopez X, Jain R.",Y,MED
Can Bioactive Food Substances Contribute to Cystic Fibrosis-Related Cardiovascular Disease Prevention?,"Advances in cystic fibrosis (CF) care have significantly improved the quality of life and life expectancy of patients. Nutritional therapy based on a high-calorie, high-fat diet, antibiotics, as well as new therapies focused on CFTR modulators change the natural course of the disease. They do so by improving pulmonary function and growing BMI. However, the increased weight of such patients can lead to unwanted long-term cardiovascular effects. People with CF (pwCF) experience several cardiovascular risk factors. Such factors include a high-fat diet and increased dietary intake, altered lipid metabolism, a decrease in the level of fat-soluble antioxidants, heightened systemic inflammation, therapeutic interventions, and diabetes mellitus. PwCF must pay special attention to food and eating habits in order to maintain a nutritional status that is as close as possible to the proper physiological one. They also have to benefit from appropriate nutritional counseling, which is essential in the evolution and prognosis of the disease. Growing evidence collected in the last years shows that many bioactive food components, such as phytochemicals, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and antioxidants have favorable effects in the management of CF. An important positive effect is cardiovascular prevention. The possibility of preventing/reducing cardiovascular risk in CF patients enhances both quality of life and life expectancy in the long run.",36678185,PMC9860597,10.3390/nu15020314,,2023,"Trandafir LM, Frăsinariu OE, Țarcă E, Butnariu LI, Leon Constantin MM, Moscalu M, Temneanu OR, Melinte Popescu AS, Popescu MGM, Stârcea IM, Cojocaru E, Moisa SM.",Y,MED
"Respiratory Infection and Inflammation in Cystic Fibrosis: A Dynamic Interplay among the Host, Microbes, and Environment for the Ages.","The interplay between airway inflammation and infection is now recognized as a major factor in the pathobiology in cystic fibrosis (CF). A proinflammatory environment is seen throughout the CF airway resulting in classic marked and enduring neutrophilic infiltrations, irreversibly damaging the lung. Although this is seen to occur early, independent of infection, respiratory microbes arising at different timepoints in life and the world environment perpetuate this hyperinflammatory state. Several selective pressures have allowed for the CF gene to persist until today despite an early mortality. Comprehensive care systems, which have been a cornerstone of therapy for the past few decades, are now revolutionized by CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CTFR) modulators.

Longitudinal profiling of the intestinal microbiome in children with cystic fibrosis treated with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor.,"The intestinal microbiome influences growth and disease progression in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA), the newest pharmaceutical modulator for CF, restores the function of the pathogenic mutated CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel. We performed a single-center longitudinal analysis of the effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA on the intestinal microbiome, intestinal inflammation, and clinical parameters in children with CF. Following ELX/TEZ/IVA, children with CF had significant improvements in body mass index and percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second, and required fewer antibiotics for respiratory infections. Intestinal microbiome diversity increased following ELX/TEZ/IVA coupled with a decrease in the intestinal carriage of *Staphylococcus aureus*, the predominant respiratory pathogen in children with CF. There was a reduced abundance of microbiome-encoded antibiotic resistance genes. Microbial pathways for aerobic respiration were reduced after ELX/TEZ/IVA. The abundance of microbial acid tolerance genes was reduced, indicating microbial adaptation to increased CFTR function. In all, this study represents the first comprehensive analysis of the intestinal microbiome in children with CF receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA.IMPORTANCECystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with significant gastrointestinal symptoms in addition to pulmonary complications. Recently approved treatments for CF, CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators, are anticipated to substantially improve the care of people with CF and extend their lifespans. Prior work has shown that the intestinal microbiome correlates with health outcomes in CF, particularly in children. Here, we study the intestinal microbiome of children with CF before and after the CFTR modulator, ELX/TEZ/IVA. We identify promising improvements in microbiome diversity, reduced measures of intestinal inflammation, and reduced antibiotic resistance genes. We present specific bacterial taxa and protein groups which change following ELX/TEZ/IVA. These results will inform future mechanistic studies to understand the microbial improvements associated with CFTR modulator treatment. This study demonstrates how the microbiome can change in response to a targeted medication that corrects a genetic disease.",38275294,PMC10865789,10.1128/mbio.01935-23,,2024,"Reasoner SA, Bernard R, Waalkes A, Penewit K, Lewis J, Sokolow AG, Brown RF, Edwards KM, Salipante SJ, Hadjifrangiskou M, Nicholson MR.",Y,MED

Changes in the Cystic Fibrosis Airway Microbiome in Response to CFTR Modulator Therapy.,"The development of CFTR modulator therapies significantly changed the treatment scheme of people with cystic fibrosis. However, CFTR modulator therapy is still a life-long treatment, which is not able to correct the genetic defect and cure the disease. Therefore, it becomes crucial to understand the effects of such modulation of CFTR function on the airway physiology, especially on airway infections and inflammation that are currently the major life-limiting factors in people with cystic fibrosis. In this context, understanding the dynamics of airway microbiome changes in response to modulator therapy plays an essential role in developing strategies for managing airway infections. Whether and how the newly available therapies affect the airway microbiome is still at the beginning of being deciphered. We present here a brief review summarizing the latest information about microbiome alterations in light of modern cystic fibrosis modulator therapy.",33816324,PMC8010178,10.3389/fcimb.2021.548613,,2021,"Yi B, Dalpke AH, Boutin S.",Y,MED
"Novel inhalation therapy in pulmonary fibrosis: principles, applications and prospects.","Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) threatens millions of people worldwide with its irreversible progression. Although the underlying pathogenesis of PF is not fully understood, there is evidence to suggest that the disease can be blocked at various stages. Inhalation therapy has been applied for lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and its application for treating PF is currently under consideration. New techniques in inhalation therapy, such as the application of microparticles and nanoparticles, traditional Chinese medicine monomers, gene therapy, inhibitors, or agonists of signaling pathways, extracellular vesicle interventions, and other specific drugs, are effective in treating PF. However, the safety and effectiveness of these therapeutic techniques are influenced by the properties of inhaled particles, biological and pathological barriers, and the type of inhalation device used. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the pharmacological, pharmaceutical, technical, preclinical, and clinical experimental aspects of novel inhalation therapy for treating PF and focus on therapeutic methods that significantly improve existing technologies or expand the range of drugs that can be administered via inhalation. Although inhalation therapy for PF has some limitations, the advantages are significant, and further research and innovation about new inhalation techniques and drugs are encouraged.",38553716,PMC10981316,10.1186/s12951-024-02407-6,,2024,"Zheng M, Zhu W, Gao F, Zhuo Y, Zheng M, Wu G, Feng C.",Y,MED
Concomitant Use of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor and Etanercept in a Cystic Fibrosis Patient with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis.,"Patients with cystic fibrosis often complain of joint manifestations. However, only a few studies have reported the association between cystic fibrosis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis and addressed the therapeutic challenges of these patients. We describe the first paediatric case of a patient affected by cystic fibrosis, Basedow's disease and juvenile idiopathic arthritis who was contemporarily treated with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) and anti-tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNFα). This report seems to reassure regarding the potential side effects of these associations. Moreover, our experience suggests that anti-TNFα is an effective option in CF patients affected by juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and is even safe for children receiving a triple *CFTR* modulator.",36902517,PMC10003532,10.3390/jcm12051730,,2023,"Orsini SI, Marrani E, Pagnini I, Taccetti G, Terlizzi V, Simonini G.",Y,MED
Dysfunctional Inflammation in Cystic Fibrosis Airways: From Mechanisms to Novel Therapeutic Approaches.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, an ATP-gated chloride channel expressed on the apical surface of airway epithelial cells. CFTR absence/dysfunction results in defective ion transport and subsequent airway surface liquid dehydration that severely compromise the airway microenvironment. Noxious agents and pathogens are entrapped inside the abnormally thick mucus layer and establish a highly inflammatory environment, ultimately leading to lung damage. Since chronic airway inflammation plays a crucial role in CF pathophysiology, several studies have investigated the mechanisms responsible for the altered inflammatory/immune response that, in turn, exacerbates the epithelial dysfunction and infection susceptibility in CF patients. In this review, we address the evidence for a critical role of dysfunctional inflammation in lung damage in CF and discuss current therapeutic approaches targeting this condition, as well as potential new treatments that have been developed recently. Traditional therapeutic strategies have shown several limitations and limited clinical benefits. Therefore, many efforts have been made to develop alternative treatments and novel therapeutic approaches, and recent findings have identified new molecules as potential anti-inflammatory agents that may exert beneficial effects in CF patients. Furthermore, the potential anti-inflammatory properties of CFTR modulators, a class of drugs that directly target the molecular defect of CF, also will be critically reviewed. Finally, we also will discuss the possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on CF patients, with a major focus on the consequences that the viral infection could have on the persistent inflammation in these patients.",33669352,PMC7920244,10.3390/ijms22041952,,2021,"Ghigo A, Prono G, Riccardi E, De Rose V.",Y,MED

Cumulative Incidence and Risk Factors for Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 in French People With Cystic Fibrosis.,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are closely monitored in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), especially severe cases. Previous studies used hospitalization rates as proxy for severity.Methods: We evaluated data from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases diagnosed in French pwCF over the first pandemic year. Objective criteria were applied for defining severity (eg, respiratory failure and/or death). Data were compared to all French pwCF using the National Registry.Results: As of 30 April 2021, 223 pwCF were diagnosed with COVID-19, with higher risks in adults (odds ratio [OR], 2.52 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.82-3.48]) and transplant recipients (OR, 2.68 [95% CI, 1.98-3.63]). Sixty (26.9%) patients were hospitalized, with increased risk in transplant recipients (OR, 4.74 [95% CI, 2.49-9.02]). In 34 (15%) cases, COVID-19 was considered severe; 28 (46.7%) hospitalizations occurred without objective criteria of severity. Severe cases occurred mostly in adult (85.3%) and posttransplant pwCF (61.8%; OR, 6.02 [95% CI, 2.77-13.06]). In nontransplanted pwCF, risk factors for severity included low lung function (median percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second, 54.6% vs 75.1%; OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01-1.08]) and CF-related diabetes (OR, 3.26 [95% CI, 1.02-10.4]). While 204 cases fully recovered, 16 were followed for possible sequelae, and 3 posttransplant females died.Conclusions: Severe COVID-19 occurred infrequently during the first pandemic year in French pwCF. Nontransplanted adults with severe respiratory disease or diabetes and posttransplant individuals were at risk for severe COVID-19.

New Therapies to Correct the Cystic Fibrosis Basic Defect.,"Rare diseases affect 400 million individuals worldwide and cause significant morbidity and mortality. Finding solutions for rare diseases can be very challenging for physicians and researchers. Cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic, autosomal recessive, multisystemic, life-limiting disease does not escape this sad reality. Despite phenomenal progress in our understanding of this disease, treatment remains difficult. Until recently, therapies for CF individuals were focused on symptom management. The discovery of the *cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator* (*CFTR*) gene and its product, a protein present at the apical surface of epithelial cells regulating ion transport, allowed the scientific community to learn about the basic defect in CF and to study potential therapies targeting the dysfunctional protein. In the past few years, promising therapies with the goal to restore CFTR function became available and changed the lives of several CF patients. These medications, called CFTR modulators, aim to correct, potentialize, stabilize or amplify CFTR function. Furthermore, research is ongoing to develop other targeted therapies that could be more efficient and benefit a larger proportion of the CF community. The purpose of this review is to summarize our current knowledge of CF genetics and therapies restoring CFTR function, particularly CFTR modulators and gene therapy.",34201249,PMC8227161,10.3390/ijms22126193,,2021,"Bergeron C, Cantin AM.",Y,MED

Cystic fibrosis patients on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulators have a reduced incidence of cirrhosis.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators significantly improve pulmonary function in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) but the effect on hepatobiliary outcomes remains unknown. We hypothesized that CF patients on CFTR modulators would have a decreased incidence of cirrhosis compared to patients not on CFTR modulators or on ursodiol.Aim: To investigate the effect of CFTR modulators on the development of cirrhosis in patients with CF.Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed using Truven MarketScan from January 2012 through December 2017 including all patients with a diagnosis of CF. Patients were excluded if they underwent a liver transplantation or if they had other etiologies of liver disease including viral hepatitis or alcohol use. Subjects were grouped by use of CFTR modulators, ursodiol, dual therapy, or no therapy. The primary outcome was development of cirrhosis. Kaplan-Meier curves estimated the incidence of cirrhosis and log-rank tests compared incidence curves between treatment groups.Results: A total of 7201 patients were included, of which 955 (12.6%) used a CFTR modulator, 529 (7.0%) used ursodiol, 105 (1.4%) used combination therapy, and 5612 (74.3%) used neither therapy. The incidence of cirrhosis was 0.1% at 1 year and 0.7% at 4 years in untreated patients, 5.9% and 10.1% in the Ursodiol group, and 1.0% and 1.0% in patients who received both therapies. No patient treated with CFTR modulators alone developed cirrhosis. Patients on CFTR modulators alone had lower cirrhosis incidence than untreated patients (*P* = 0.05), patients on Ursodiol (*P* < 0.001), and patients on dual therapy (*P* = 0.003). The highest incidence of cirrhosis was found among patients treated with Ursodiol alone, compared to untreated patients (*P* < 0.001) or patients on Ursodiol and CFTR modulators (*P* = 0.01).Conclusion: CFTR modulators are associated with a reduction in the incidence of cirrhosis compared to other therapies in patients with CF.",35317183,PMC8891668,10.4254/wjh.v14.i2.411,,2022,"Ramsey ML, Wellner MR, Porter K, Kirkby SE, Li SS, Lara LF, Kelly SG, Hanje AJ, Sobotka LA.",Y,MED
Cystic Fibrosis Human Organs-on-a-Chip.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene: the gene product responsible for transporting chloride and bicarbonate ions through the apical membrane of most epithelial cells. Major clinical features of CF include respiratory failure, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and intestinal disease. Many CF animal models have been generated, but some models fail to fully capture the phenotypic manifestations of human CF disease. Other models that better capture the key characteristics of the human CF phenotype are cost prohibitive or require special care to maintain. Important differences have been reported between the pathophysiology seen in human CF patients and in animal models. These limitations present significant limitations to translational research. This review outlines the study of CF using patient-derived organs-on-a-chip to overcome some of these limitations. Recently developed microfluidic-based organs-on-a-chip provide a human experimental model that allows researchers to manipulate environmental factors and mimic in vivo conditions. These chips may be scaled to support pharmaceutical studies and may also be used to study organ systems and human disease. The use of these chips in CF discovery science enables researchers to avoid the barriers inherent in animal models and promote the advancement of personalized medicine.",34202364,PMC8305167,10.3390/mi12070747,,2021,"Ogden HL, Kim H, Wikenheiser-Brokamp KA, Naren AP, Mun KS.",Y,MED
A Review of Trikafta: Triple Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Modulator Therapy.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a potentially fatal genetic disease that causes serious lung damage. With time, researchers have a more complete understanding of the molecular-biological defects that underlie CF. This knowledge is leading to alternative approaches regarding the treatment of this condition. Trikafta is the third FDA-approved drug that targets the F508del mutation of the CFTR gene. The drug is a combination of three individual drugs which are elexacaftor (ELX), tezacaftor (TEZ), and ivacaftor (IVA). This trio increases the activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein and reduces the mortality and morbidity rates in CF patients. The effectiveness of Trikafta, seen in clinical trials, outperforms currently available therapies in terms of lung function, quality of life, sweat chloride reduction, and pulmonary exacerbation reduction. The safety and efficacy of CFTR modulators in children with CF have also been studied. Continued evaluation of patient data is needed to confirm its long-term safety and efficacy. In this study, we will focus on reviewing data from clinical trials regarding the benefits of CFTR modulator therapy. We address the impact of Trikafta on lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, and quality of life. Adverse events of the different CFTR modulators are discussed.",34268058,PMC8266292,10.7759/cureus.16144,,2021,"Zaher A, ElSaygh J, Elsori D, ElSaygh H, Sanni A.",Y,MED
Evolving Nutritional Needs in Cystic Fibrosis.,"The course of cystic fibrosis (CF) as a nutritional illness is diverging since the introduction of highly effective modulator therapy, leading to more heterogeneous phenotypes of the disease despite CF genetic mutations that portend worse prognosis. This may become more evident as we follow the pediatric CF population into adulthood as some highly effective modulator therapies (HEMT) are approved for those as young as 1 year old. This review will outline the current research and knowledge available in the evolving nutritional health of people with CF as it relates to the impact of HEMT on anthropometrics, body composition, and energy expenditure, exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiencies (the latter resulting in CF-related diabetes), vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and nutritional health in CF as it relates to pregnancy and lung transplantation.",37511806,PMC10381916,10.3390/life13071431,,2023,"Frantzen T, Barsky S, LaVecchia G, Marowitz M, Wang J.",Y,MED
Resilience and stability of the CF- intestinal and respiratory microbiome during nutritional and exercise intervention.,"Background: Impaired respiratory and intestinal microbiome composition is linked to cystic fibrosis lung disease severity. In people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), regular exercise is recommended to delay disease progression and preserve a stable lung function. An optimal nutritional status is vital for best clinical outcomes. Our study investigated whether regular and monitored exercise and nutritional support promotes CF microbiome health.Methods: A personalized nutrition and exercise program promoted nutritional intake and physical fitness in 18 pwCF for 12 months. Throughout the study, patients performed strength and endurance training monitored by a sports scientist via an internet platform. After three months, food supplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus LGG was introduced. Nutritional status and physical fitness were assessed before the study started, after three and nine months. Sputum and stool were collected, and microbial composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.Results: Sputum and stool microbiome composition remained stable and highly specific to each patient during the study period. Disease-associated pathogens dominated sputum composition. Lung disease severity and recent antibiotic treatment had the highest impact on taxonomic composition in stool and sputum microbiome. Strikingly, the long-term antibiotic treatment burden had only a minor influence.Conclusion: Despite the exercise and nutritional intervention, respiratory and intestinal microbiomes proved to be resilient. Dominant pathogens drove the composition and functionality of the microbiome. Further studies are required to understand which therapy could destabilize the dominant disease-associated microbial composition of pwCF.",36803565,PMC9942320,10.1186/s12866-023-02788-y,,2023,"Knoll RL, Jarquín-Díaz VH, Klopp J, Kemper A, Hilbert K, Hillen B, Pfirrmann D, Simon P, Bähner V, Nitsche O, Gehring S, Markó L, Forslund SK, Poplawska K.",Y,MED
"Epithelial vectorial ion transport in cystic fibrosis: Dysfunction, measurement, and pharmacotherapy to target the primary deficit.","Cystic fibrosis patients display multi-organ system dysfunction (e.g. pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and lung) with pathogenesis linked to a failure of Cl- secretion from the epithelial surfaces of these organs. If unmanaged, organ dysfunction starts early and patients experience chronic respiratory infection with reduced lung function and a failure to thrive due to gastrointestinal malabsorption. Early mortality is typically caused by respiratory failure. In the past 40 years of newborn screening and improved disease management have driven the median survival up from the mid-teens to 43-53, with most of that improvement coming from earlier and more aggressive management of the symptoms. In the last decade, promising pharmacotherapies have been developed for the correction of the underlying epithelial dysfunction, namely, Cl- secretion. A new generation of systemic drugs target the mutated Cl- channels in cystic fibrosis patients and allow trafficking of the immature mutated protein to the cell membrane (correctors), restore function to the channel once in situ (potentiators), or increase protein levels in the cells (amplifiers). Restoration of channel function prior to symptom development has the potential to significantly change the trajectory of disease progression and their evidence suggests that a modest restoration of Cl- secretion may delay disease progression by decades. In this article, we review epithelial vectorial ion and fluid transport, its quantification and measurement as a marker for cystic fibrosis ion transport dysfunction, and highlight some of the recent therapies targeted at the dysfunctional ion transport of cystic fibrosis.",32637102,PMC7323271,10.1177/2050312120933807,,2020,"Clunes LA, McMillan-Castanares N, Mehta N, Mesadieu A, Rodriguez J, Maj M, Clunes MT.",Y,MED
Cystic Fibrosis Point of Personalized Detection (CFPOPD): An Interactive Web Application.,"Background: Despite steady gains in life expectancy, individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease still experience rapid pulmonary decline throughout their clinical course, which can ultimately end in respiratory failure. Point-of-care tools for accurate and timely information regarding the risk of rapid decline is essential for clinical decision support.Objective: This study aims to translate a novel algorithm for earlier, more accurate prediction of rapid lung function decline in patients with CF into an interactive web-based application that can be integrated within electronic health record systems, via collaborative development with clinicians.Methods: Longitudinal clinical history, lung function measurements, and time-invariant characteristics were obtained for 30,879 patients with CF who were followed in the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (2003-2015). We iteratively developed the application using the R Shiny framework and by conducting a qualitative study with care provider focus groups (N=17).Results: A clinical conceptual model and 4 themes were identified through coded feedback from application users: (1) ambiguity in rapid decline, (2) clinical utility, (3) clinical significance, and (4) specific suggested revisions. These themes were used to revise our application to the currently released version, available online for exploration. This study has advanced the application's potential prognostic utility for monitoring individuals with CF lung disease. Further application development will incorporate additional clinical characteristics requested by the users and also a more modular layout that can be useful for care provider and family interactions.Conclusions: Our framework for creating an interactive and visual analytics platform enables generalized development of applications to synthesize, model, and translate electronic health data, thereby enhancing clinical decision support and improving care and health outcomes for chronic diseases and disorders. A prospective implementation study is necessary to evaluate this tool's effectiveness regarding increased communication, enhanced shared decision-making, and improved clinical outcomes for patients with CF.",33325834,PMC7773511,10.2196/23530,,2020,"Wolfe C, Pestian T, Gecili E, Su W, Keogh RH, Pestian JP, Seid M, Diggle PJ, Ziady A, Clancy JP, Grossoehme DH, Szczesniak RD, Brokamp C.",Y,MED
SLC6A14 Impacts Cystic Fibrosis Lung Disease Severity *via* mTOR and Epithelial Repair Modulation.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF), due to pathogenic variants in *CFTR* gene, is associated with chronic infection/inflammation responsible for airway epithelium alteration and lung function decline. Modifier genes induce phenotype variability between people with CF (pwCF) carrying the same *CFTR* variants. Among these, the gene encoding for the amino acid transporter SLC6A14 has been associated with lung disease severity and age of primary airway infection by the bacteria *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. In this study, we investigated whether the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3788766, located within *SLC6A14* promoter, is associated with lung disease severity in a large French cohort of pwCF. We also studied the consequences of this SNP on *SLC6A14* promoter activity using a luciferase reporter and the role of SLC6A14 in the mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) signaling pathway and airway epithelial repair. We confirm that *SLC6A14* rs3788766 SNP is associated with lung disease severity in pwCF (*p* = 0.020; *n* = 3,257, pancreatic insufficient, aged 6-40 years old), with the minor allele G being deleterious. In bronchial epithelial cell lines deficient for *CFTR*, *SLC6A14* promoter activity is reduced in the presence of the rs3788766 G allele. SLC6A14 inhibition with a specific pharmacological blocker reduced 3H-arginine transport, mTOR phosphorylation, and bronchial epithelial repair rates in wound healing assays. To conclude, our study highlights that *SLC6A14* genotype might affect lung disease severity of people with cystic fibrosis *via* mTOR and epithelial repair mechanism modulation in the lung.",35372502,PMC8965518,10.3389/fmolb.2022.850261,,2022,"Mercier J, Calmel C, Mésinèle J, Sutanto E, Merabtene F, Longchampt E, Sage E, Kicic A, Boëlle PY, Corvol H, Ruffin M, Guillot L.",Y,MED
Risk factors for respiratory Aspergillus fumigatus in German Cystic Fibrosis patients and impact on lung function.,"Airway inflammation and chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are mostly caused by bacteria, e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). The role of fungi in the CF lung is still not well elucidated, but evidence for a harmful and complex role is getting stronger. The most common filamentous fungus in CF is Aspergillus fumigatus (AF). Age and continuous antibiotic treatment have been discussed as risk factors for AF colonisation but did not differentiate between transient and persistent AF colonisation. Also, the impact of co-colonisation of PA and AF on lung function is still under investigation. Data from patients with CF registered in the German Cystic Fibrosis Registry database in 2016 and 2017 were retrospectively analysed, involving descriptive and multivariate analysis to assess risk factors for transient or persistent AF colonisation. Age represented an independent risk factor for persistent AF colonisation. Prevalence was low in children less than ten years, highest in the middle age and getting lower in higher age (≥ 50 years). Continuous antibiotic lung treatment was significantly associated with AF prevalence in all age groups. CF patients with chronic PA infection had a lower lung function (FEV1%predicted), which was not influenced by an additional AF colonisation. AF colonisation without chronic PA infection, however, was significantly associated with a lower function, too. Older age up to 49 years and continuous antibiotic use were found to be the main risk factors for AF permanent colonisation. AF might be associated with decrease of lung function if not disguised by chronic PA infection.",33149181,PMC7643137,10.1038/s41598-020-75886-w,,2020,"Düesberg U, Wosniok J, Naehrlich L, Eschenhagen P, Schwarz C.",Y,MED
Novel CFTR modulator combinations maximise rescue of G85E and N1303K in rectal organoids.,"Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a severe monogenic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene. Several types of CFTR modulators (correctors/potentiators) have been developed to overcome protein dysfunction associated with these mutations. CFTR modulator therapy is now available for the major CF-causing mutations; however, 10% of people with CF remain without causal treatments. By combining investigational and market-approved CFTR modulators, we aimed to maximise functional rescue of iva-, luma- and tezacaftor refractory mutants G85E and N1303K.Methods: We used the well-established forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) in primary rectal organoids to assess responses to different CFTR corrector and potentiator types. The FIS analysis was performed with brightfield microscopy, allowing both 1-h and 24-h follow-up. Corrector and potentiator activity of elexacaftor was investigated.Results: For G85E, maximal rescue was observed by a combination of elexacaftor and corr4a. For N1303K, the quadruple combination teza-elexa-ivacaftor with apigenin was required to obtain a rescue similar to that of luma-ivacaftor rescued F508del. Elexacaftor rescued G85E and N1303K by different mechanisms, with chronic corrector effects on G85E and acute potentiation of N1303K only in the presence of ivacaftor. Synergy in N1303K rescue for iva-elexacaftor and apigenin suggests at least three potentiator mechanisms for this mutant. 24-h FIS identified ivacaftor as the main CFTR modulator for N1303K and elexacaftor and apigenin as co-potentiators.Conclusions: Novel combinations of CFTR modulators can further improve functional rescue of G85E and N1303K in rectal organoids, although for N1303K, more effective CFTR modulators are still needed.",35449760,PMC9016267,10.1183/23120541.00716-2021,,2022,"Ensinck MM, De Keersmaecker L, Ramalho AS, Cuyx S, Van Biervliet S, Dupont L, Christ F, Debyser Z, Vermeulen F, Carlon MS.",Y,MED
Modulation of Ion Transport to Restore Airway Hydration in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene which codes for the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel. Loss of Cl- secretion across the apical membrane of airway lining epithelial cells results in dehydration of the airway surface liquid (ASL) layer which impairs mucociliary clearance (MCC), and as a consequence promotes bacterial infection and inflammation of the airways. Interventions that restore airway hydration are known to improve MCC. Here we review the ion channels present at the luminal surface of airway epithelial cells that may be targeted to improve airway hydration and MCC in CF airways.",33810137,PMC8004921,10.3390/genes12030453,,2021,"Reihill JA, Douglas LEJ, Martin SL.",Y,MED
Mucins and CFTR: Their Close Relationship.,"Mucociliary clearance is a critical defense mechanism for the lungs governed by regionally coordinated epithelial cellular activities, including mucin secretion, cilia beating, and transepithelial ion transport. Cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal genetic disorder caused by the dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel, is characterized by failed mucociliary clearance due to abnormal mucus biophysical properties. In recent years, with the development of highly effective modulator therapies, the quality of life of a significant number of people living with CF has greatly improved; however, further understanding the cellular biology relevant to CFTR and airway mucus biochemical interactions are necessary to develop novel therapies aimed at restoring *CFTR* gene expression in the lungs. In this article, we discuss recent advances of transcriptome analysis at single-cell levels that revealed a heretofore unanticipated close relationship between secretory MUC5AC and MUC5B mucins and CFTR in the lungs. In addition, we review recent findings on airway mucus biochemical and biophysical properties, focusing on how mucin secretion and CFTR-mediated ion transport are integrated to maintain airway mucus homeostasis in health and how CFTR dysfunction and restoration of function affect mucus properties.",36142171,PMC9499620,10.3390/ijms231810232,,2022,"Okuda K, Shaffer KM, Ehre C.",Y,MED
Ex vivo model predicted in vivo efficacy of CFTR modulator therapy in a child with rare genotype.,"Background: New drugs that target the basic defect in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients may now be used in a large number of patients carrying responsive mutations. Nevertheless, further research is needed to extend the benefit of these treatments to patients with rare mutations that are still uncharacterized in vitro and that are not included in clinical trials. For this purpose, ex vivo models are necessary to preliminary assessing the effect of CFTR modulators in these cases.Method: We report the clinical effectiveness of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy prescribed to a CF child with a rare genetic profile (p.Phe508del/p.Gly970Asp) after testing the drug on nasal epithelial cells. We observed a significant drop of the sweat chloride value, as of the lung clearance index. A longer follow-up period is needed to define the effects of therapy on pancreatic status, although an increase of the fecal elastase values was found.Conclusion: Drug response obtained on nasal epithelial cells correlates with changes in vivo therapeutic endpoints and can be a predictor of clinical efficacy of novel drugs especially in pediatric patients.",33713579,PMC8123755,10.1002/mgg3.1656,,2021,"Terlizzi V, Amato F, Castellani C, Ferrari B, Galietta LJV, Castaldo G, Taccetti G.",Y,MED
"Multimodal analysis of granulocytes, monocytes, and platelets in patients with cystic fibrosis before and after Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor treatment.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenetic disease caused by an impairment of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CF affects multiple organs and is associated with acute and chronic inflammation. In 2020, Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor (ETI) was approved to enhance and restore the remaining CFTR functionality. This study investigates cellular innate immunity, with a focus on neutrophil activation and phenotype, comparing healthy volunteers with patients with CF before (T1, n = 13) and after six months (T2, n = 11) of ETI treatment. ETI treatment reduced sweat chloride (T1: 95 mmol/l (83|108) vs. T2: 32 mmol/l (25|62), p < 0.01, median, first|third quartile) and significantly improved pulmonal function (FEV1 T1: 2.66 l (1.92|3.04) vs. T2: 3.69 l (3.00|4.03), p < 0.01). Moreover, there was a significant decrease in the biomarker human epididymis protein 4 (T1: 6.2 ng/ml (4.6|6.3) vs. T2: 3.0 ng/ml (2.2|3.7), p < 0.01) and a small but significant decrease in matrix metallopeptidase 9 (T1: 45.5 ng/ml (32.5|140.1) vs. T2: 28.2 ng/ml (18.2|33.6), p < 0.05). Neutrophil phenotype (CD10, CD11b, CD62L, and CD66b) and function (radical oxygen species generation, chemotactic and phagocytic activity) remained largely unaffected by ETI treatment. Likewise, monocyte phenotype and markers of platelet activation were similar at T1 and T2. In summary, the present study confirmed a positive impact on patients with CF after ETI treatment. However, neither beneficial nor harmful effects of ETI treatment on cellular innate immunity could be detected, possibly due to the study population consisting of patients with well-controlled CF.",37457734,PMC10347380,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1180282,,2023,"Schmidt H, Höpfer LM, Wohlgemuth L, Knapp CL, Mohamed AOK, Stukan L, Münnich F, Hüsken D, Koller AS, Stratmann AEP, Müller P, Braun CK, Fabricius D, Bode SFN, Huber-Lang M, Messerer DAC.",Y,MED
Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor Treatment Reduces Abdominal Symptoms in Cystic Fibrosis-Early results Obtained With the CF-Specific CFAbd-Score.,"**Background:** The novel and highly effective CFTR modulator combination of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) has been shown to improve lung function and body weight in people with Cystic Fibrosis (pwCF) carrying a F508del mutation. However, the impact of these modulators on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms is relatively unknown. Therefore, the CFAbd-Score was developed and validated following FDA recommendations for development of a PROM including focus groups, multidisciplinary CF specialists, people with CF and their families. The aim of this study was to assess effects of ETI on GI symptoms using the CFAbd-Score. **Methods:** Gastrointestinal symptoms were prospectively assessed in pwCF using the CFAbd-Score before and up to 26 weeks during therapy. The CFAbd-Score was also administered to a healthy control (HC) group. The one-sided questionnaire includes 28 items grouped in five domains. Data analysis included calculation of scores with a weighting tool, developed according to FDA recommendations. **Results:** A total of 107 pwCF attended in four CF centres in Germany and four centres in the UK completed the CFAbd-Score on at least two occasions. Results were compared to those obtained from the questionnaire of 45 HCs. Despite differences in demographics, age and proportion of pancreatic insufficiency between German and UK patients, analyses based on linear mixed-effects models at week 24 of ETI therapy revealed that estimated marginal means (EMMs) of total CFAbd-Scores significantly reduced (mean ± SE: 14.9 ± 1.2→10.6 ± 1.4; *p* < 0.01). Also EMMs of all five domains significantly declined (""pain"" 16.3 ± 1.6→10.2 ± 2.3, ""GERD"" 15.8 ± 1.8→8.2 ± 1.9, ""disorders of bowel movement"" 20.9 ± 1.5→16.0 ± 1.7, ""disorders of appetite"" 7.9 ± 1.1→2.6 ± 1.1 and ""quality of life impairment"" 10.1 ± 1.92→3.9 ± 1.9). However, during 24 weeks, CF participants' symptoms mostly still did not reach the reference levels of HCs. **Discussion:** Using the CFAbd-Score, the first PROM specifically developed for assessment of CF-related abdominal symptoms, we demonstrate comprehensive improvements in GI symptoms after initiation of the highly effective modulator therapy ETI.",35721187,PMC9203829,10.3389/fphar.2022.877118,,2022,"Mainz JG, Zagoya C, Polte L, Naehrlich L, Sasse L, Eickmeier O, Smaczny C, Barucha A, Bechinger L, Duckstein F, Kurzidim L, Eschenhagen P, Caley L, Peckham D, Schwarz C.",Y,MED
Future therapies for cystic fibrosis.,"We are currently witnessing transformative change for people with cystic fibrosis with the introduction of small molecule, mutation-specific drugs capable of restoring function of the defective protein, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). However, despite being a single gene disorder, there are multiple cystic fibrosis-causing genetic variants; mutation-specific drugs are not suitable for all genetic variants and also do not correct all the multisystem clinical manifestations of the disease. For many, there will remain a need for improved treatments. Those patients with gene variants responsive to CFTR modulators may have found these therapies to be transformational; research is now focusing on safely reducing the burden of symptom-directed treatment. However, modulators are not available in all parts of the globe, an issue which is further widening existing health inequalities. For patients who are not suitable for- or do not have access to- modulator drugs, alternative approaches are progressing through the trials pipeline. There will be challenges encountered in design and implementation of these trials, for which the established global CF infrastructure is a major advantage. Here, the Cystic Fibrosis National Research Strategy Group of the UK NIHR Respiratory Translational Research Collaboration looks to the future of cystic fibrosis therapies and consider priorities for future research and development.",36755044,PMC9907205,10.1038/s41467-023-36244-2,,2023,"Allen L, Allen L, Carr SB, Davies G, Downey D, Egan M, Forton JT, Gray R, Haworth C, Horsley A, Smyth AR, Southern KW, Davies JC.",Y,MED
Treatment of Pulmonary Disease of Cystic Fibrosis: A Comprehensive Review.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that causes absence or dysfunction of a protein named transmembrane conductance regulatory protein (CFTR) that works as an anion channel. As a result, the secretions of the organs where CFTR is expressed are very viscous, so their functionality is altered. The main cause of morbidity is due to the involvement of the respiratory system as a result of recurrent respiratory infections by different pathogens. In recent decades, survival has been increasing, rising by around age 50. This is due to the monitoring of patients in multidisciplinary units, early diagnosis with neonatal screening, and advances in treatments. In this chapter, we will approach the different therapies used in CF for the treatment of symptoms, obstruction, inflammation, and infection. Moreover, we will discuss specific and personalized treatments to correct the defective gene and repair the altered protein CFTR. The obstacle for personalized CF treatment is to predict the drug response of patients due to genetic complexity and heterogeneity of uncommon mutations.",33922413,PMC8144952,10.3390/antibiotics10050486,,2021,"Girón Moreno RM, García-Clemente M, Diab-Cáceres L, Martínez-Vergara A, Martínez-García MÁ, Gómez-Punter RM.",Y,MED
Potential of Intestinal Current Measurement for Personalized Treatment of Patients with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Refinement of personalized treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) with emerging medicines targeting the CF basic defect will likely benefit from biomarkers sensitive to detect improvement of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function in individual patients. Intestinal current measurement (ICM) is a technique that enables quantitative assessment of CFTR chloride channel function in rectal tissues or other intestinal epithelia. ICM was originally developed to study the CF ion transport defect in the intestine and has been established as a sensitive biomarker of CFTR function and diagnostic test for CF. With the emergence of CFTR-directed therapeutics, ICM has become an important tool to estimate the level of rescue of CFTR function achieved by approved CFTR modulators, both at the level of *CFTR* genotype groups, as well as individual patients with CF. In combination with preclinical patient-derived cell culture models, ICM may aid the development of targeted therapies for patients with rare *CFTR* mutations. Here, we review the principles of ICM and examine how this CFTR biomarker may be used to support diagnostic testing and enhance personalized medicine for individual patients with common as well as rare *CFTR* mutations in the new era of medicines targeting the underlying cause of CF.",34066648,PMC8151208,10.3390/jpm11050384,,2021,"Graeber SY, Vitzthum C, Mall MA.",Y,MED
Clinical and Genetic Characterisation of Cystic Fibrosis Patients in Latvia: A Twenty-Five-Year Experience.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting genetic disorder in European descent populations. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the CFTR gene, and inheritance is autosomal recessive. This study provides an up-to-date, comprehensive estimation of the distribution of CFTR pathogenic variants in Latvia and their phenotypic characteristics. It also reports the first results of the CF newborn screening programme following its implementation in 2019. We analysed the clinical and molecular data of CF patients treated at the only tertiary hospital in Latvia providing specialised healthcare for the disorder. Between 1997 and 2022, 66 CF patients from 62 families were diagnosed based on symptoms or a molecular confirmation (six patients were diagnosed through the CF newborn screening programme). F508del was identified in 70.5% of all CF chromosomes. Known variants were identified in more than one family: dele2,3, R1006H, L1335P, W57R, R553X, 2143delT and 3849+10kb C>T (legacy names used). Furthermore, two novel variants were identified, namely, c.503C>A p.(Ser168Ter) and c.(743+1_744-1)_(1584+1_1585-1)del p.(?). The available follow-up results indicated that Latvian CF patients demonstrated similar tendencies to CF patients worldwide. The oldest age at diagnosis prior to the implementation of the CF newborn screening programme was 14 years. We provide here, for the first time, a comprehensive description of Latvian CF patients. An improvement in the healthcare of CF patients over time, including access to diagnosis, is evident. Two novel CF-causing variants are reported, and F508del is the most frequently occurring variant in the population, thus suggesting that F508del screening should be followed by the testing of the full CFTR gene.",36428953,PMC9689702,10.3390/diagnostics12112893,,2022,"Auzenbaha M, Aleksejeva E, Taurina G, Kornejeva L, Kempa I, Svabe V, Gailite L.",Y,MED
Using metabolic potential within the airway microbiome as predictors of clinical state in persons with cystic fibrosis.,"Introduction: Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) in persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) are primarily related to acute or chronic inflammation associated with bacterial lung infections, which may be caused by several bacteria that activate similar bacterial genes and produce similar by-products. The goal of our study was to perform a stratified functional analysis of bacterial genes at three distinct time points in the treatment of a PEx in order to determine the role that specific airway microbiome community members may play within each clinical state (i.e., PEx, end of antibiotic treatment, and follow-up). Our secondary goal was to compare the change between clinical states with the metabolic activity of specific airway microbiome community members.Methods: This was a prospective observational study of persons with CF treated with intravenous antibiotics for PEx between 2016 and 2020 at Children's National Hospital. Demographic and clinical information as well as respiratory samples were collected at hospital admission for PEx, end of antibiotic treatment, and follow-up. Metagenomic sequencing was performed; MetaPhlAn3 and HUMANn3 were used to assign sequences to bacterial species and bacterial metabolic genes, respectively.Results: Twenty-two persons with CF, with a mean age of 14.5 (range 7-23) years, experienced 45 PEx during the study period. Two-hundred twenty-one bacterial species were identified in the respiratory samples from the study cohort. Ten bacterial species had differential gene abundance across changes in the clinical state including *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Streptococcus salivarius*, and *Veillonella atypica* (all padj < 0.01 and log2FoldChange > |2|). These corresponded to a differential abundance of bacterial genes, with *S. aureus* accounting for 81% of the genes more abundant in PEx and *S. salivarius* accounting for 83% of the genes more abundant in follow-up, all compared to the end of treatment. Lastly, 8,653 metabolic pathways were identified across samples, with again *S. aureus* and *S. salivarius* contributing to the differential abundance of pathways (106 in PEx vs. 66 in follow-up, respectively). *V. atypica* was associated with a single metabolic pathway (UDP-*N*-acetyl-D-glucosamine biosynthesis) increased in follow-up compared to PEx.Discussion: Taken together, these data suggest that the metabolic potential of bacterial species can provide more insight into changes across clinical states than the relative abundance of the bacteria alone.",36698799,PMC9868313,10.3389/fmed.2022.1082125,,2022,"Shumyatsky G, Burrell A, Chaney H, Sami I, Koumbourlis AC, Freishtat RJ, Crandall KA, Zemanick ET, Hahn A.",Y,MED
An Overview of Frog Skin-Derived Esc Peptides: Promising Multifunctional Weapons against *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*-Induced Pulmonary and Ocular Surface Infections.,"Antimicrobial resistance is a silent pandemic harming human health, and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is the most common bacterium responsible for chronic pulmonary and eye infections. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics. In this review, the in vitro/in vivo activities of the frog skin-derived AMP Esc(1-21) are shown. Esc(1-21) rapidly kills both the planktonic and sessile forms of *P. aeruginosa* and stimulates migration of epithelial cells, likely favoring repair of damaged tissue. However, to undertake preclinical studies, some drawbacks of AMPs (cytotoxicity, poor biostability, and limited delivery to the target site) must be overcome. For this purpose, the stereochemistry of two amino acids of Esc(1-21) was changed to obtain the diastereomer Esc(1-21)-1c, which is more stable, less cytotoxic, and more efficient in treating *P. aeruginosa*-induced lung and cornea infections in mouse models. Incorporation of these peptides (Esc peptides) into nanoparticles or immobilization to a medical device (contact lens) was revealed to be an effective strategy to ameliorate and/or to prolong the peptides' antimicrobial efficacy. Overall, these data make Esc peptides encouraging candidates for novel multifunctional drugs to treat lung pathology especially in patients with cystic fibrosis and eye dysfunctions, characterized by both tissue injury and bacterial infection.",38673985,PMC11049899,10.3390/ijms25084400,,2024,"Mangoni ML, Loffredo MR, Casciaro B, Ferrera L, Cappiello F.",Y,MED
Prediction of Real-World Long-Term Outcomes of People with CF Homozygous for the F508del Mutation Treated with CFTR Modulators.,"The clinical response to cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators is variable within people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) homozygous for the F508del mutation. The prediction of clinical effect in individual patients would be useful to target therapy to those who would benefit from it. A multicenter observational cohort study was conducted including 97 pwCF (F508del/F508del), who started lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) treatment before June 2018. In order to assess the associations of individual in vivo and in vitro biomarkers with clinical outcomes, we collected clinical data regarding sex, age, and sweat chloride concentration (SwCl) at baseline and after six months of LUM/IVA; the percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV1) and the number of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) during the three years before up to three years after modulator initiation; and the forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) responses to LUM/IVA, quantified in intestinal organoids. On a group level, the results showed an acute change in ppFEV1 after LUM/IVA initiation (2.34%, 95% CI 0.85-3.82, *p* = 0.003), but no significant change in annual ppFEV1 decline in the three years after LUM/IVA compared to the three years before (change: 0.11% per year, 95%CI: -1.94-2.19, *p* = 0.913). Neither of these two outcomes was associated with any of the candidate predictors on an individual level. The median number of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) per patient year did not significantly change in the three years after LUM/IVA compared to the years before (median: 0.33/patient year, IQR: 0-0.67 before vs. median: 0/patient year, IQR: 0-0.67 after *p* = 0. 268). The PEx rate after modulator initiation was associated with the PEx rate before (IRR: 2.26, 95%CI: 1.67-3.08, *p* < 0.001), with sex (males vs. females IRR: 0.36, 95%CI: 0.21-0.63, *p* = 0.001) and with sweat chloride concentration (SwCl) at baseline (IRR: 0.96, 95%CI: 0.94-0.98, *p* = 0.001). The change in SwCl was also significant (-22.9 mmol/L (95%CI: -27.1--18.8, *p* < 0.001) and was associated with SwCl at baseline (-0.64, 95%CI: -0.90--0.37, *p* < 0.001) and with sex (males vs. females 8.32, 95%CI: 1.82-14.82, *p* = 0.013). In conclusion, ppFEV1 decline after CFTR modulator initiation remains difficult to predict in individual patients in a real-world setting, with limited effectiveness for double CFTR modulator therapies. The PEx rate prior to CFTR modulator treatment initiation, sex and SwCl at baseline could be potential predictors of long-term PEx rate and of changes in SwCl after modulator initiation.",34945848,PMC8707616,10.3390/jpm11121376,,2021,"Muilwijk D, Bierlaagh M, van Mourik P, Kraaijkamp J, van der Meer R, van den Bor R, Heijerman H, Eijkemans R, Beekman J, van der Ent K.",Y,MED
Factors associated with clinical progression to severe COVID-19 in people with cystic fibrosis: A global observational study.,"Background: This international study aimed to characterise the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with cystic fibrosis and investigate factors associated with severe outcomes. Methods Data from 22 countries prior to 13th December 2020 and the introduction of vaccines were included. It was de-identified and included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, treatments, outcomes and sequalae following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with clinical progression to severe COVID-19, using the primary outcome of hospitalisation with supplemental oxygen.Results: SARS-CoV-2 was reported in 1555 people with CF, 1452 were included in the analysis. One third were aged <18 years, and 9.4% were solid-organ transplant recipients. 74.5% were symptomatic and 22% were admitted to hospital. In the non-transplanted cohort, 39.5% of patients with ppFEV1<40% were hospitalised with oxygen verses 3.2% with ppFEV >70%: a 17-fold increase in odds. Worse outcomes were independently associated with older age, non-white race, underweight body mass index, and CF-related diabetes. Prescription of highly effective CFTR modulator therapies was associated with a significantly reduced odds of being hospitalised with oxygen (AOR 0.43 95%CI 0.31-0.60 p<0.001). Transplanted patients were hospitalised with supplemental oxygen therapy (21.9%) more often than non-transplanted (8.8%) and was independently associated with the primary outcome (Adjusted OR 2.45 95%CI 1.27-4.71 p=0.007).Conclusions: This is the first study to show that there is a protective effect from the use of CFTR modulator therapy and that people with CF from an ethnic minority are at more risk of severe infection with SARS-CoV-2.",35753987,PMC9189103,10.1016/j.jcf.2022.06.006,,2022,"Carr SB, McClenaghan E, Elbert A, Faro A, Cosgriff R, Abdrakhmanov O, Brownlee K, Burgel PR, Byrnes CA, Cheng SY, Colombo C, Corvol H, Daneau G, Goss CH, Gulmans V, Gutierrez H, Harutyunyan S, Helmick M, Jung A, Kashirskaya N, McKone E, Melo J, Middleton PG, Mondejar-Lopez P, de Monestrol I, Nährlich L, Padoan R, Parker M, Pastor-Vivero MD, Rizvi S, Ruseckaite R, Salvatore M, da Silva-Filho LVRF, Versmessen N, Zampoli M, Marshall BC, Stephenson AL, CF Registry Global Collaboration.",Y,MED
Emerging Concepts in Defective Macrophage Phagocytosis in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Chronic inflammation and decline in lung function are major reasons for morbidity in CF. Mutant CFTR expressed in phagocytic cells such as macrophages contributes to persistent infection, inflammation, and lung disease in CF. Macrophages play a central role in innate immunity by eliminating pathogenic microbes by a process called phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is required for tissue homeostasis, balancing inflammation, and crosstalk with the adaptive immune system for antigen presentation. This review focused on (1) current understandings of the signaling underlying phagocytic mechanisms; (2) existing evidence for phagocytic dysregulation in CF; and (3) the emerging role of CFTR modulators in influencing CF phagocytic function. Alterations in CF macrophages from receptor initiation to phagosome formation are linked to disease progression in CF. A deeper understanding of macrophages in the context of CFTR and phagocytosis proteins at each step of phagosome formation might contribute to the new therapeutic development of dysregulated innate immunity in CF. Therefore, the review also indicates future areas of research in the context of CFTR and macrophages.",35887098,PMC9319215,10.3390/ijms23147750,,2022,"Jaganathan D, Bruscia EM, Kopp BT.",Y,MED
*Pseudomonas aeruginosa* in chronic lung disease: untangling the dysregulated host immune response.,"*Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is a highly adaptable opportunistic pathogen capable of exploiting barriers and immune defects to cause chronic lung infections in conditions such as cystic fibrosis. In these contexts, host immune responses are ineffective at clearing persistent bacterial infection, instead driving a cycle of inflammatory lung damage. This review outlines key components of the host immune response to chronic *P. aeruginosa* infection within the lung, beginning with initial pathogen recognition, followed by a robust yet maladaptive innate immune response, and an ineffective adaptive immune response that propagates lung damage while permitting bacterial persistence. Untangling the interplay between host immunity and chronic *P. aeruginosa* infection will allow for the development and refinement of strategies to modulate immune-associated lung damage and potentiate the immune system to combat chronic infection more effectively.",39015565,PMC11250099,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1405376,,2024,"Nickerson R, Thornton CS, Johnston B, Lee AHY, Cheng Z.",Y,MED
Tezacaftor/ivacaftor in people with cystic fibrosis who stopped lumacaftor/ivacaftor due to respiratory adverse events.,"Background: Increased rates of respiratory adverse events have been observed in people ≥12 years of age with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the Phe508del-CFTR mutation treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor, particularly in those with percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV1) of <40%. We evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in people with cystic fibrosis homozygous for Phe508del-CFTR who discontinued lumacaftor/ivacaftor due to treatment-related respiratory signs or symptoms.Methods: Participants ≥12 years of age with cystic fibrosis homozygous for Phe508del-CFTR with ppFEV1 of ≥25% and ≤90% were randomized 1:1 and treated with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or placebo for 56 days.Results: Of 97 participants, 94 (96.9%) completed the study. The primary endpoint was incidence of predefined respiratory adverse events of special interest (chest discomfort, dyspnea, respiration abnormal, asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, bronchospasm, and wheezing): tezacaftor/ivacaftor, 14.0%; placebo, 21.3%. The adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. None were serious or led to treatment interruption or discontinuation. Overall, the discontinuation rate was similar between groups. The mean (SD) ppFEV1 at baseline was 44.6% (16.1%) with tezacaftor/ivacaftor and 48.0% (18.1%) with placebo. The posterior mean difference in absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline to the average value of days 28 and 56 was 2.7 percentage points with tezacaftor/ivacaftor vs placebo.Conclusions: Tezacaftor/ivacaftor was generally safe, well tolerated, and efficacious in people ≥12 years of age with cystic fibrosis homozygous for Phe508del-CFTR with ppFEV1 of ≥25% and ≤90% who previously discontinued lumacaftor/ivacaftor due to treatment-related respiratory signs or symptoms.",32586736,PMC9187869,10.1016/j.jcf.2020.06.001,,2021,"Schwarz C, Sutharsan S, Epaud R, Klingsberg RC, Fischer R, Rowe SM, Audhya PK, Ahluwalia N, You X, Ferro TJ, Duncan ME, Bruinsma BG.",Y,MED

Management of Individual Patient Expectations When Starting with Highly Effective CFTR Modulators.,"Highly effective CFTR modulators such as elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELE/TEZ/IVA will become available for an increasing number of people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) in the near future. Before the start of this therapy, many questions may arise concerning the expected effects. We assembled the currently available data from the literature about ELE/TEZ/IVA that focused on commonly asked questions from patients. Overall, the literature so far presents a very hopeful prospect of effects, not only on lung function, but also on nutritional status, sinonasal symptoms and quality of life. The effects in patients with pwCF with severe lung damage are also favorable. Treatment is generally well tolerated.

The Application of Bicarbonate Recovers the Chemical-Physical Properties of Airway Surface Liquid in Cystic Fibrosis Epithelia Models.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease associated with the defective function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein that causes obstructive disease and chronic bacterial infections in airway epithelia. Deletion of phenylalanine at position 508, p.F508del, the most frequent mutation among CF patients, causes a folding and traffic defect, resulting in a dramatic reduction in the CFTR expression. To investigate whether the direct application of bicarbonate could modify the properties of the airway surface liquid (ASL), we measured the micro-viscosity, fluid transport and pH of human bronchial epithelial cells monolayers. We have demonstrated that the treatment of a CF-epithelia with an iso-osmotic solution containing bicarbonate is capable of reducing both, the ASL viscosity and the apical fluid re-absorption. We suggest the possibility of design a supportive treatment based on topical application of bicarbonate, or any other alkaline buffer.",33805545,PMC8065534,10.3390/biology10040278,,2021,"Ferrera L, Capurro V, Delpiano L, Gianotti A, Moran O.",Y,MED
Changes in Microbiome Dominance Are Associated With Declining Lung Function and Fluctuating Inflammation in People With Cystic Fibrosis.,"Airway inflammation and microbiome dysbiosis are hallmarks of cystic fibrosis (*CF*) lung disease. However, longitudinal studies are needed to decipher which factors contribute to the long-term evolution of these key features of *CF.* We therefore evaluated the relationship between fluctuation in microbiome and inflammatory parameters in a longitudinal study including a short- (1-year) and a long-term (3+ years) period. We collected 118 sputum samples from 26 *CF* adult patients and analyzed them by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We measured the levels of inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil elastase, and anti-proteinases; lung function (FEV1% predicted); and BMI. The longitudinal evolution was analyzed based on (i) the rates of changes; (ii) the intra-patient stability of the variables; and (iii) the dependency of the rates of changes on the baseline values. We observed that the diversity of the microbiome was highly variable over a 1-year period, while the inflammatory markers showed a slower evolution, with significant changes only observed in the 3+ year cohort. Further, the degree of fluctuation of the biomass and the dominance of the microbiome were associated with changes in inflammatory markers, especially IL-1β and IL-8. This longitudinal study demonstrates for the first time that the long-term establishment and periodical variation of the abundance of a dominant pathogen is associated with a more severe increase in inflammation. This result indicates that a single time point or 1-year study might fail to reveal the correlation between microbial evolution and clinical degradation in cystic fibrosis.",35633718,PMC9136159,10.3389/fmicb.2022.885822,,2022,"Frey DL, Bridson C, Dittrich S, Graeber SY, Stahl M, Wege S, Herth F, Sommerburg O, Schultz C, Dalpke A, Mall MA, Boutin S.",Y,MED
Characterizing mucociliary clearance in young children with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: This research characterized mucociliary clearance (MCC) in young children with cystic fibrosis (CF).Methods: Fourteen children (5-7 years old) with CF underwent: two baseline MCC measurements (Visits 1 and 2); one MCC measurement approximately 1 year later (Visit 3); and measurements of lung clearance index (LCI), a measure of ventilation inhomogeneity.Results: Median (range) percent MCC through 60 min (MCC60) was similar on Visits 1 and 2 with 11.0 (0.9-33.7) and 12.8 (2.7-26.8), respectively (p = 0.95), and reproducible (Spearman Rho = 0.69; p = 0.007). Mucociliary clearance did not change significantly over 1 year with median percent MCC60 on Visit 3 [12.8 (3.7-17.6)] similar to Visit 2 (p = 0.58). Lower percent MCC60 on Visit 3 was significantly associated with higher LCI scores on Visit 3 (N = 14; Spearman Rho = -0.56; p = 0.04).Conclusions: Tests of MCC were reproducible and reliable over a 2-week period and stable over a 1-year period in 5-7-year-old children with CF. Lower MCC values were associated with increased ventilation inhomogeneity. These results suggest that measurements of MCC could be used in short-term clinical trials of interventions designed to modulate MCC and as a new, non-invasive test to evaluate early lung pathology in children with CF.Impact: This is the first study to characterize mucociliary clearance (MCC) in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) who were 5-7 years old. Measurements of mucociliary clearance were reproducible and reliable over a 2-week period and stable over a 1-year period. Variability in MCC between children was associated with differences in ventilation homogeneity, such that children with lower MCC values had increased ventilation inhomogeneity. These results suggest that measurements of MCC could be used in short-term clinical trials of interventions designed to modulate MCC and as a new, non-invasive test to evaluate early lung pathology in children with CF.",33753897,PMC8455702,10.1038/s41390-021-01453-2,,2022,"Laube BL, Carson KA, Evans CM, Aksit MA, Collaco JM, Richardson VL, Sharpless G, Zeitlin PL, Cutting GR, Mogayzel PJ.",Y,MED
Impact of Airway Inflammation on the Efficacy of CFTR Modulators.,"Defective CFTR biogenesis and activity in cystic fibrosis airways leads to airway dehydration and impaired mucociliary clearance, resulting in chronic airway infection and inflammation. Most cystic fibrosis patients have at least one copy of the F508del CFTR mutation, which results in a protein retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded by the proteosomal pathway. CFTR modulators, e.g., correctors, promote the transfer of F508del to the apical membrane, while potentiators increase CFTR activity. Corrector and potentiator double therapies modestly improve lung function, whereas triple therapies with two correctors and one potentiator indicate improved outcomes. Enhanced F508del rescue by CFTR modulators is achieved by exposing F508del/F508del primary cultures of human bronchial epithelia to relevant inflammatory stimuli, i.e., supernatant from mucopurulent material or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from human cystic fibrosis airways. Inflammation enhances the biochemical and functional rescue of F508del by double or triple CFTR modulator therapy and overcomes abrogation of CFTR correction by chronic VX-770 treatment in vitro. Furthermore, the impact of inflammation on clinical outcomes linked to CFTR rescue has been recently suggested. This review discusses these data and possible mechanisms for airway inflammation-enhanced F508del rescue. Expanding the understanding of how airway inflammation improves CFTR rescue may benefit cystic fibrosis patients.",34831482,PMC8619863,10.3390/cells10113260,,2021,"Ribeiro CMP, Gentzsch M.",Y,MED
Rhinosinusitis: Evidence and experience - 2024.,"It has been 10-years since the publication of Rhinosinusitis: evidence and experience, and since then a lot has changed in our understanding of the disease. Advances in pathophysiology, endotyping and new treatments such as biologics brought a new era in the management of our patients. This new guideline, developed jointly by ABR and ABORL-CCF, with the help of ASBAI presents an updated, evidence-based approach to the different forms of rhinosinusitis that aims to improve the diagnosis and treatment of this complex disease. The document covers a wide range of topics, including clear definitions of the different stages of acute sinusitis. It also introduces a new term called Prolonged Acute Viral Rhinosinusitis. Reviews phenotypes and endotypes of chronic rhinosinusitis, recommending methods for clinical and laboratory investigation, clinical and surgical treatment. We also discuss in detail fungal sinusitis and pediatric sinusitis. The objective of this updated Consensus is to clarify some already established and recent concepts, highlighting the importance of an accurate diagnosis to promote treatment approaches that reflect the best practices based on solid evidence.

The short-term effects of ORKAMBI (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) on regional and distal lung structures using functional respiratory imaging.,"Background: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) has shown modest benefits in previous research, but the exact effects in the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung remain unclear. This study aims to offer novel information on the mode of action of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-modulating drug by assessing lung structure and function using functional respiratory imaging (FRI).Methods: CF patients aged ⩾12 years homozygous for *F508del* were recruited in an open-label study. Before and after 12 weeks of treatment with LUM/IVA, FRI was used to visualize regional information, such as air trapping, lobar volume and airway wall volume. Secondary outcomes included the CF-CT scoring system, spirometry, the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) questionnaire, exercise tolerance and nutritional status.Results: Of the 12 patients enrolled in the study, 11 completed all study visits. Concerning the FRI parameters, hyperinflation of the lung decreased, indicated by a reduction in air trapping and lobar volume at expiration. Also, a decrease in airway wall volume and a redistribution of pulmonary blood volume were noted, which might be related to a decrease in mucus impaction. Airway resistance, airway volume, internal airflow distribution and aerosol deposition pattern did not show significant changes. No significant improvements were found in any of the CF-CT scores or in the spirometric parameters. Other secondary outcomes showed similar results compared with previous research. Correlations at baseline were found between FRI and conventional outcomes, including physical functioning, spirometry and CF-CT scores.Conclusions: LUM/IVA decreased lung hyperinflation in combination with a potential decrease in mucus impaction, which can be related to an improved mucociliary transport. These results indicate that several FRI parameters, reflecting regional and distal lung structures, are more sensitive to changes caused by LUM/IVA than conventional respiratory outcomes.",34541955,PMC8461124,10.1177/17534666211046774,,2021,"Lauwers E, Belmans D, Mignot B, Ides K, Van Hoorenbeeck K, Snoeckx A, Van Holsbeke C, Nowé V, Van Braeckel E, De Backer W, De Backer J, Verhulst S.",Y,MED
An observational study of anaerobic bacteria in cystic fibrosis lung using culture dependant and independent approaches.,"Strict anaerobes are undeniably important residents of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung but are still unknowns. The main objectives of this study were to describe anaerobic bacteria diversity in CF airway microbiota and to evaluate the association with lung function. An observational study was conducted during eight months. A hundred and one patients were enrolled in the study, and 150 sputum samples were collected using a sterile sample kit designed to preserve anaerobic conditions. An extended-culture approach on 112 sputa and a molecular approach (quantitative PCR targeting three of the main anaerobic genera in CF lung: Prevotella, Veillonella, and Fusobacterium) on 141 sputa were developed. On culture, 91.1% of sputa were positive for at least one anaerobic bacterial species, with an average of six anaerobic species detected per sputum. Thirty-one anaerobic genera and 69 species were found, which is the largest anaerobe diversity ever reported in CF lungs. Better lung function (defined as Forced Expiratory Volume in one second > 70%) was significantly associated with higher quantification of Veillonella. These results raise the question of the potential impact of anaerobes on lung function.",33767218,PMC7994387,10.1038/s41598-021-85592-w,,2021,"Lamoureux C, Guilloux CA, Beauruelle C, Gouriou S, Ramel S, Dirou A, Le Bihan J, Revert K, Ropars T, Lagrafeuille R, Vallet S, Le Berre R, Nowak E, Héry-Arnaud G.",Y,MED
"A Compositional Analysis of Physical Activity, Sedentary Time, and Sleep and Associated Health Outcomes in Children and Adults with Cystic Fibrosis.","This study sought to investigate the association of light physical activity (LPA), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sedentary time (SED), and sleep with lung function in children and adults with CF. In total, 86 children (41 females; 13.6 ± 2.8 years; FEV1%predicted: 86 ± 1%) and 43 adults (21 females; 24.6 ± 4.7 years; FEV1%predicted: 63 ± 21%) with CF participated in this study. Wrist-worn accelerometery was used to assess PA, SED and sleep. Compositional linear regression models were conducted following normalisation via isometric log-ratio transformations. Sequential binary partitioning was applied to investigate the impact of reallocating 10 to 30 min between each behaviour on FEV1%predicted. A decline in FEV1%predicted was predicted with the reallocation of 30 min from MVPA to SED or LPA or sleep to any other behaviour in children (-3.04--0.005%) and adults (-3.58--0.005%). Conversely, improvements in FEV1%predicted were predicted when 30 min was reallocated to MVPA from LPA or SED in children (0.12-1.59%) and adults (0.77-2.10%), or when 30 min was reallocated to sleep from any other behaviour in both children (0.23-2.56%) and adults (1.08-3.58%). This study supports the importance of MVPA and sleep for maintaining and promoting lung function in people with CF.",35564550,PMC9102111,10.3390/ijerph19095155,,2022,"Bianchim MS, McNarry MA, Holland A, Cox NS, Dreger J, Barker AR, Williams CA, Denford S, Mackintosh KA.",Y,MED
Non-Coding RNAs in Pulmonary Diseases: Comparison of Different Airway-Derived Biosamples.,"Due to their structural conservation and functional role in critical signalling pathways, non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is a promising biomarker and modulator of pathological conditions. Most research has focussed on the role of microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs). These molecules have been investigated both in a cellular and an extracellular context. Sources of ncRNAs may include organ-specific body fluids. Therefore, studies on ncRNAs in respiratory diseases include those on sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and exhaled breath condensate (EBC). It is worth identifying the limitations of these biosamples in terms of ncRNA abundance, processing and diagnostic potential. This review describes the progress in the literature on the role of ncRNAs in the pathogenesis and progression of severe respiratory diseases, including cystic fibrosis, asthma and interstitial lung disease. We showed that there is a deficit of information on lncRNAs and circRNAs in selected diseases, despite attempts to functionally bind them to miRNAs. miRNAs remain the most well-studied, but only a few investigations have been conducted on the least invasive biosample material, i.e., EBC. To summarise the studies conducted to date, we also performed a preliminary in silico analysis of the reported miRNAs, demonstrating the complexity of their role and interactions in selected respiratory diseases.",36768329,PMC9916756,10.3390/ijms24032006,,2023,"Stachowiak Z, Narożna B, Szczepankiewicz A.",Y,MED
Sweat Chloride Testing and Nasal Potential Difference (NPD) Are Primary Outcome Parameters in Treatment with Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Modulators.,"With the advent of CFTR modulators, surrogate outcome parameters that accurately quantify the improvement in CFTR activity are needed. In vivo biomarkers that reflect CFTR ion transport and can serve as outcomes in the treatment of CFTR modulators are the sweat Cl- test (SCT), the nasal potential difference (NPD) measurement or the intestinal current measurement (ICM). This review focus on the SCT and NPD. The SCT displays a low intra-patient variability in contrast to the NPD. It has been used extensively as a biomarker of CFTR function in clinical trials of CFTR modulator therapies and provides evidence for change in the short term. The level of functional rescue in the NPD increases up to 40% of normal CFTR in patients with a Gly551Asp treated with ivacaftor monotherapy, while in F508del homozygous patients treated with ivacaftor-lumacaftor, activity increased on average up to ~20% of normal activity. While both tests provide evidence of the effect on CFTR activity, they cannot be used at an individual level to predict the response to any CFTR modulators. Nevertheless, their rapid modification, reflecting electrophysiological properties, highlight their potential use in proof-of-concept studies for CFTR modulators.",34442373,PMC8398324,10.3390/jpm11080729,,2021,"Sermet-Gaudelus I, Nguyen-Khoa T, Hatton A, Hayes K, Pranke I.",Y,MED
"CFTR Modulators: Impact on Fertility, Pregnancy, and Lactation in Women with Cystic Fibrosis.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. These mutations lead to abnormal ion transport in mucous membranes throughout the body, including in the respiratory and gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts. Improvements in care and therapy have led to substantial increases in the quantity and quality of life for those with CF. Consequently, women with CF are increasingly interested in having families. Although pregnancy was once discouraged for women with CF, at this point, even women with moderately severe lung disease can successfully navigate pregnancy. With the recent approval of a triple combination CFTR modulator therapy that improves lung function, nutritional status, and quality of life for people with a single copy of the most common CFTR mutation, it is expected that the number of women with CF who choose to become pregnant will continue to increase. Although animal reproduction models show no alarming signals for use during pregnancy at normal human doses, there is a paucity of human safety data in pregnancy and lactation. This review summarizes what is currently known about the impact of use of CFTR modulators on fertility, pregnancy, and lactation in women with CF.",32825766,PMC7563981,10.3390/jcm9092706,,2020,Taylor-Cousar JL.,Y,MED
Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor Therapy for Cystic Fibrosis Patients with The F508del/Unknown Genotype.,"The new CFTR modulator combination, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Trikafta) was approved by the FDA in October 2019 for treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in patients 6 years of age or older who have at least one F508del mutation in one allele and a minimal-function or another F508del mutation in the other allele. However, there is a group of patients, in addition to those with rare mutations, in which despite the presence of a F508del in one allele, it was not possible to identify any mutation in the other allele. To date, these patients are excluded from treatment with Trikafta in Italy, where the CF patients carrying F508del/unknown represent about 1.3% (71 patients) of the overall Italian CF patients. In this paper we show that the Trikafta treatment of nasal epithelial cells, derived from F508del/Unknown patients, results in a significant rescue of CFTR activity. Based on our findings, we think that the F508del/Unknown patients considered in this study could obtain clinical benefits from Trikafta treatment, and we strongly suggest their eligibility for this type of treatment. This study, adding further evidence in the literature, once again confirms the validity of functional studies on nasal cells in the cystic fibrosis theratyping and personalized medicine.",34356748,PMC8300667,10.3390/antibiotics10070828,,2021,"Comegna M, Terlizzi V, Salvatore D, Colangelo C, Di Lullo AM, Zollo I, Taccetti G, Castaldo G, Amato F.",Y,MED
The L467F-F508del Complex Allele Hampers Pharmacological Rescue of Mutant CFTR by Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor in Cystic Fibrosis Patients: The Value of the Ex Vivo Nasal Epithelial Model to Address Non-Responders to CFTR-Modulating Drugs.,"Loss-of-function mutations of the *CFTR* gene cause cystic fibrosis (CF) through a variety of molecular mechanisms involving altered expression, trafficking, and/or activity of the CFTR chloride channel. The most frequent mutation among CF patients, F508del, causes multiple defects that can be, however, overcome by a combination of three pharmacological agents that improve CFTR channel trafficking and gating, namely, elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor. This study was prompted by the evidence of two CF patients, compound heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function variant, who failed to obtain any beneficial effects following treatment with the triple drug combination. Functional studies on nasal epithelia generated in vitro from these patients confirmed the lack of response to pharmacological treatment. Molecular characterization highlighted the presence of an additional amino acid substitution, L467F, in cis with the F508del variant, demonstrating that both patients were carriers of a complex allele. Functional and biochemical assays in heterologous expression systems demonstrated that the double mutant L467F-F508del has a severely reduced activity, with negligible rescue by CFTR modulators. While further studies are needed to investigate the actual prevalence of the L467F-F508del allele, our results suggest that this complex allele should be taken into consideration as plausible cause in CF patients not responding to CFTR modulators.",35328596,PMC8952007,10.3390/ijms23063175,,2022,"Sondo E, Cresta F, Pastorino C, Tomati V, Capurro V, Pesce E, Lena M, Iacomino M, Baffico AM, Coviello D, Bandiera T, Zara F, Galietta LJV, Bocciardi R, Castellani C, Pedemonte N.",Y,MED
Going the Extra Mile: Why Clinical Research in Cystic Fibrosis Must Include Children.,"This is an exciting time for research and novel drug development in cystic fibrosis. However, rarely has the adage, ""Children are not just little adults"" been more relevant. This article is divided into two main sections. In the first, we explore why it is important to involve children in research. We discuss the potential benefits of understanding a disease and its treatment in children, and we highlight that children have the same legal and ethical right to evidence-based therapy as adults. Additionally, we discuss why extrapolation from adults may be inappropriate, for example, medication pharmacokinetics may be different in children, and there may be unpredictable adverse effects. In the second part, we discuss how to involve children and their families in research. We outline the importance and the complexities of selecting appropriate outcome measures, and we discuss the role co-design may have in improving the involvement of children. We highlight the importance of appropriate staffing and resourcing, and we outline some of the common challenges and possible solutions, including practical tips on obtaining consent/assent in children and adolescents. We conclude that it is unethical to simply rely on extrapolation from adult studies because research in young children is challenging and that research should be seen as a normal part of the paediatric therapeutic journey.",35884064,PMC9323167,10.3390/children9071080,,2022,"Dobra R, Bentley S, Edmondson C, Ovens M, Saunders C, Short C, Wilson G, Davies JC, Bush A.",Y,MED
Improved outcomes in cystic fibrosis using modified Re-Education of Airway Clearance Technique (REACT) programme.,"Background and objectives: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is known to reduce lung function as measured by per cent predicted for the forced expiratory volume in the first second (ppFEV1) over time. Our paediatric CF programme demonstrated significant gaps in benchmarked ppFEV1 predicted compared with the national median. Our objective was to assess whether the implementation of a modified Re-Education of Airway Clearance Techniques (REACT) programme could lead to an improvement in lung function as measured by ppFEV1.Methods: This 2-year prospective quality improvement study at Lurie Children's CF Center for children aged >6 years used improvement methodology to implement a modified REACT programme. Outcome measures were assessed for our entire programme via the CF Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) and statistical process control. Comparisons were also made before and after REACT for outcome measures.Results: By the end of implementation, monthly participation rate achieved 100%. Using CFFPR data and SPC, median ppFEV1 increased by 3.9%, whereas only body mass index (BMI) as a secondary outcome increased. Comparison of pre and post REACT showed improvements in average ppFEV1 (95% vs 96%, p<0.0001), FEF25%-75% (82% vs 83%, p=0.0590), rate of ppFEV1 decline (+2% vs -4%, p=0.0262) and BMI percentile (57% vs 60%, p<0.0001).Conclusions: Implementation of a modified REACT at Lurie Children's paediatric CF programme led to an increase in ppFEV1, FEF25%-75% and BMI percentile.",32675178,PMC7368470,10.1136/bmjoq-2019-000890,,2020,"Reamer C, O'Malley C, Nufer J, Savant A.",Y,MED
"S945L-CFTR molecular dynamics, functional characterization and tezacaftor/ivacaftor efficacy *in vivo* and *in vitro* in matched pediatric patient-derived cell models.","Cystic Fibrosis (CF) results from over 400 different disease-causing mutations in the CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (*CFTR*) gene. These *CFTR* mutations lead to numerous defects in CFTR protein function. A novel class of targeted therapies (CFTR modulators) have been developed that can restore defects in CFTR folding and gating. This study aimed to characterize the functional and structural defects of S945L-CFTR and interrogate the efficacy of modulators with two modes of action: gating potentiator [ivacaftor (IVA)] and folding corrector [tezacaftor (TEZ)]. The response to these modulators *in vitro* in airway differentiated cell models created from a participant with S945L/G542X-CFTR was correlated with *in vivo* clinical outcomes of that participant at least 12 months pre and post modulator therapy. In this participants' airway cell models, CFTR-mediated chloride transport was assessed *via* ion transport electrophysiology. Monotherapy with IVA or TEZ increased CFTR activity, albeit not reaching statistical significance. Combination therapy with TEZ/IVA significantly (*p *= 0.02) increased CFTR activity 1.62-fold above baseline. Assessment of CFTR expression and maturation *via* western blot validated the presence of mature, fully glycosylated CFTR, which increased 4.1-fold in TEZ/IVA-treated cells. The *in vitro* S945L-CFTR response to modulator correlated with an improvement in *in vivo* lung function (ppFEV1) from 77.19 in the 12 months pre TEZ/IVA to 80.79 in the 12 months post TEZ/IVA. The slope of decline in ppFEV1 significantly (*p *= 0.02) changed in the 24 months post TEZ/IVA, becoming positive. Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in clinical parameters and a fall in sweat chloride from 68 to 28 mmol/L. The mechanism of dysfunction of S945L-CFTR was elucidated by *in silico* molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. S945L-CFTR caused misfolding of transmembrane helix 8 and disruption of the R domain, a CFTR domain critical to channel gating. This study showed *in vitro* and *in silico* that S945L causes both folding and gating defects in CFTR and demonstrated *in vitro* and *in vivo* that TEZ/IVA is an efficacious modulator combination to address these defects. As such, we support the utility of patient-derived cell models and MD simulations in predicting and understanding the effect of modulators on CFTR function on an individualized basis.",36467478,PMC9709344,10.3389/fped.2022.1062766,,2022,"Allan KM, Astore MA, Fawcett LK, Wong SL, Chen PC, Griffith R, Jaffe A, Kuyucak S, Waters SA.",Y,MED
Cystic Fibrosis Lung Disease Modifiers and Their Relevance in the New Era of Precision Medicine.,"Our understanding of cystic fibrosis (CF) has grown exponentially since the discovery of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene in 1989. With evolving genetic and genomic tools, we have come to better understand the role of *CFTR* genotypes in the pathophysiology of the disease. This, in turn, has paved the way for the development of modulator therapies targeted at mutations in the *CFTR*, which are arguably one of the greatest advances in the treatment of CF. These modulator therapies, however, do not target all the mutations in *CFTR* that are seen in patients with CF and, furthermore, a variation in response is seen in patients with the same genotype who are taking modulator therapies. There is growing evidence to support the role of non-CFTR modifiers, both genetic and environmental, in determining the variation seen in CF morbidity and mortality and also in the response to existing therapies. This review focusses on key findings from studies using candidate gene and genome-wide approaches to identify CF modifier genes of lung disease in cystic fibrosis and considers the interaction between modifiers and the response to modulator therapies. As the use of modulator therapies expands and we gain data around outcomes, it will be of great interest to investigate this interaction further. Going forward, it will also be crucial to better understand the relative influence of genomic versus environmental factors. With this understanding, we can truly begin to deliver personalised care by better profiling the likely disease phenotype for each patient and their response to treatment.",33924524,PMC8069009,10.3390/genes12040562,,2021,"Sepahzad A, Morris-Rosendahl DJ, Davies JC.",Y,MED
High frequency of complex CFTR alleles associated with c.1521_1523delCTT (F508del) in Russian cystic fibrosis patients.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF, MIM# 219,700) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by pathogenic variants within the CFTR gene.

Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Mechanisms in Chronic Airway Diseases: A Common Process to Target?,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a reversible process, in which epithelial cells lose their epithelial traits and acquire a mesenchymal phenotype. This transformation has been described in different lung diseases, such as lung cancer, interstitial lung diseases, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other muco-obstructive lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The exaggerated chronic inflammation typical of these pulmonary diseases can induce molecular reprogramming with subsequent self-sustaining aberrant and excessive profibrotic tissue repair. Over time this process leads to structural changes with progressive organ dysfunction and lung function impairment. Although having common signalling pathways, specific triggers and regulation mechanisms might be present in each disease. This review aims to describe the various mechanisms associated with fibrotic changes and airway remodelling involved in chronic airway diseases. Having better knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the EMT process may help us to identify specific targets and thus lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or limit the onset of irreversible structural changes.",37569787,PMC10418908,10.3390/ijms241512412,,2023,"Mottais A, Riberi L, Falco A, Soccal S, Gohy S, De Rose V.",Y,MED
Perspectives on the translation of in-vitro studies to precision medicine in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Recent strides towards precision medicine in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) have been made possible by patient-derived in-vitro assays with the potential to predict clinical response to small molecule-based therapies. Here, we discuss the status of primary and stem-cell derived tissues used to evaluate the preclinical efficacy of CFTR modulators highlighting both their potential and limitations. Validation of these assays requires correlation of in-vitro responses to in-vivo measures of clinical biomarkers of disease outcomes. While initial efforts have shown some success, this translation requires methodologies that are sensitive enough to capture treatment responses in a CF population that now predominantly has mild lung disease. Future development of in-vitro and in-vivo biomarkers will facilitate the generation of new therapeutics particularly for those patients with rare mutations where clinical trials are not feasible so that in the future every CF patient will have access to effective targeted therapies.",34740114,PMC8577330,10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103660,,2021,"Dumas MP, Xia S, Bear CE, Ratjen F.",Y,MED
Gene Therapy: A Possible Alternative to CFTR Modulators?,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare genetic disease that affects several organs, but lung disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. The gene responsible for CF, the *CFTR* (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene, has been discovered in 1989. Since then, gene therapy i.e., defective gene replacement by a functional one, remained the ultimate goal but unfortunately, it has not yet been achieved. However, patients care and symptomatic treatments considerably increased CF patients' life expectancy ranging from 5 years old in the 1960s to 40 today. In the last decade, research works on CFTR protein structure and activity led to the development of new drugs which, by readdressing CFTR to the plasma membrane (correctors) or by enhancing its transport activity (potentiators), allow, alone or in combination, an improvement of CF patients' lung function and quality of life. While expected, it is not yet known whether taking these drugs from an early age and for years will improve the quality of life of CF patients in the long term and further increase their life expectancy. Besides, these molecules are not available (specific variants of *CFTR*) or accessible (national health policies) for all patients and there is still no curative treatment. Another alternative that could benefit from new technologies, such as gene therapy, is therefore still attractive, although it is not yet offered to patients. Faced with the development of new CFTR correctors and potentiators, the question arises as to whether there is still a place for gene therapy and this is discussed in this perspective.",33967785,PMC8097140,10.3389/fphar.2021.648203,,2021,"Mercier J, Ruffin M, Corvol H, Guillot L.",Y,MED
Optimizing sexual and reproductive health across the lifespan in people with cystic fibrosis.,"With improved therapies, people with cystic fibrosis are living longer and healthier lives and increasingly have questions surrounding their sexual and reproductive health. This article will summarize the important issues of which providers should be aware during the lifespan of people with cystic fibrosis, including puberty, adulthood, and menopause. A wide range of sexual and reproductive health topics are addressed such as puberty, transgender and gender nonbinary identities, contraception, sexually transmitted infections, hypogonadism, sexual functioning, cyclical hemoptysis, and urinary incontinence. We discuss gaps in knowledge and current evidence as well as management strategies to optimize care. Our goal is to support providers to enable them to give comprehensive care throughout the lifespan of people with cystic fibrosis.",34570960,PMC9291766,10.1002/ppul.25703,,2022,"West NE, Kazmerski TM, Taylor-Cousar JL, Tangpricha V, Pearson K, Aitken ML, Jain R.",Y,MED

Efficacy and Safety of Triple Combination Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Modulators in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"**Background:** Cystic fibrosis is a rare, recessive, progressive genetic disease caused by dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Small molecules have recently been developed to treat the molecular consequences of CFTR mutations and restore CFTR protein function. However, the data on triple combination therapy (mainly from Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which is most tested in clinical trials) are limited. This meta-analysis was aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of this therapy according to different mutation genotypes and comparators. **Methods:** Relevant publications were identified through searching several medical databases before 31 December 2021. The primary outcomes of ppFEV1, sweat chloride concentration and Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) score were pooled and analyzed. The secondary outcomes were adverse events in triple combination therapy. **Results:** Six randomized controlled trials were eligible for analysis. The total outcome of the ppFEV1 change was higher with triple combination therapy than triple placebo or active control (mean difference, MD, 13.6% and 8.74%, respectively). The pooled result of sweat chloride concentrations with triple combination therapy was lower than that of triple placebo or active control (MD, -44.13 and -39.26, respectively). The pooled estimate of the CFQ-R score was higher with triple combination therapy than triple placebo or active control (MD, 19.8% and 14.63%, respectively). No clear differences in adverse events were found between triple combination therapy and the control (placebo or active control). **Conclusion:** CFTR modulators in triple combination achieve better clinical results than placebo and active control, and result in comparable adverse events. **Systematic Review Registration:** https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42021293402, identifier PROSPERO 2021 CRD42021293402.",35359862,PMC8964016,10.3389/fphar.2022.863280,,2022,"Wang Y, Ma B, Li W, Li P.",Y,MED
Gynecologic health care for females with cystic fibrosis.,"As females with cystic fibrosis (CF) increasingly reach their reproductive years, gynecologic issues have become an important area of clinical care and research. First, females with CF may have disease-specific gynecologic problems, including cyclic pulmonary symptoms, vaginal yeast infections, and urinary incontinence. Next, contraceptive methods are thought to be overall safe and effective, however further research is needed to confirm this and to understand the lower rates of uptake among females with CF compared to the general population. Further, females with CF have reduced fertility, although the etiology of this is unknown and under investigation. While assisted reproductive technologies may help achieve pregnancy, decision-making around parenthood remains complex. Finally, while patients and providers agree on the importance of sexual and reproductive health care, females with CF underutilize basic preventive services such as cervical cancer screening, and better approaches are needed to bridge the gap with gynecology. In this review, we discuss the current state of gynecologic care for females with CF, as well as clinical and research opportunities for improvement.",34849351,PMC8607192,10.1016/j.jcte.2021.100277,,2021,"Roe AH, Merjaneh L, Oxman R, Hughan KS.",Y,MED
CFTR Modulators: The Changing Face of Cystic Fibrosis in the Era of Precision Medicine.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal inherited disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene, which result in impairment of CFTR mRNA and protein expression, function, stability or a combination of these. Although CF leads to multifaceted clinical manifestations, the respiratory disorder represents the major cause of morbidity and mortality of these patients. The life expectancy of CF patients has substantially lengthened due to early diagnosis and improvements in symptomatic therapeutic regimens. Quality of life remains nevertheless limited, as these individuals are subjected to considerable clinical, psychosocial and economic burdens. Since the discovery of the *CFTR* gene in 1989, tremendous efforts have been made to develop therapies acting more upstream on the pathogenesis cascade, thereby overcoming the underlying dysfunctions caused by CFTR mutations. In this line, the advances in cell-based high-throughput screenings have been facilitating the fast-tracking of CFTR modulators. These modulator drugs have the ability to enhance or even restore the functional expression of specific CF-causing mutations, and they have been classified into five main groups depending on their effects on CFTR mutations: potentiators, correctors, stabilizers, read-through agents, and amplifiers. To date, four CFTR modulators have reached the market, and these pharmaceutical therapies are transforming patients' lives with short- and long-term improvements in clinical outcomes. Such breakthroughs have paved the way for the development of novel CFTR modulators, which are currently under experimental and clinical investigations. Furthermore, recent insights into the CFTR structure will be useful for the rational design of next-generation modulator drugs. This review aims to provide a summary of recent developments in CFTR-directed therapeutics. Barriers and future directions are also discussed in order to optimize treatment adherence, identify feasible and sustainable solutions for equitable access to these therapies, and continue to expand the pipeline of novel modulators that may result in effective precision medicine for all individuals with CF.",32153386,PMC7046560,10.3389/fphar.2019.01662,,2019,Lopes-Pacheco M.,Y,MED
Ligand-based virtual-screening identified a novel CFTR ligand which improves the defective cell surface expression of misfolded ABC transporters.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenetic disease caused by the mutation of CFTR, a cAMP-regulated Cl- channel expressing at the apical plasma membrane (PM) of epithelia. ∆F508-CFTR, the most common mutant in CF, fails to reach the PM due to its misfolding and premature degradation at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Recently, CFTR modulators have been developed to correct CFTR abnormalities, with some being used as therapeutic agents for CF treatment. One notable example is Trikafta, a triple combination of CFTR modulators (TEZ/ELX/IVA), which significantly enhances the functionality of ΔF508-CFTR on the PM. However, there's room for improvement in its therapeutic effectiveness since TEZ/ELX/IVA doesn't fully stabilize ΔF508-CFTR on the PM. To discover new CFTR modulators, we conducted a virtual screening of approximately 4.3 million compounds based on the chemical structures of existing CFTR modulators. This effort led us to identify a novel CFTR ligand named FR3. Unlike clinically available CFTR modulators, FR3 appears to operate through a distinct mechanism of action. FR3 enhances the functional expression of ΔF508-CFTR on the apical PM in airway epithelial cell lines by stabilizing NBD1. Notably, FR3 counteracted the degradation of mature ΔF508-CFTR, which still occurs despite the presence of TEZ/ELX/IVA. Furthermore, FR3 corrected the defective PM expression of a misfolded ABCB1 mutant. Therefore, FR3 may be a potential lead compound for addressing diseases resulting from the misfolding of ABC transporters.",38666024,PMC11043560,10.3389/fphar.2024.1370676,,2024,"Taniguchi S, Berenger F, Doi Y, Mimura A, Yamanishi Y, Okiyoneda T.",Y,MED
Organoid Technology and Its Role for Theratyping Applications in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a autosomal recessive, multisystemic disease caused by different mutations in the CFTR gene encoding CF transmembrane conductance regulator. Although symptom management is important to avoid complications, the approval of CFTR modulator drugs in the clinic has demonstrated significant improvements by targeting the primary molecular defect of CF and thereby preventing problems related to CFTR deficiency or dysfunction. CFTR modulator therapies have positively changed the patients' quality of life, especially for those who start their use at the onset of the disease. Due to early diagnosis with the implementation of newborn screening programs and considerable progress in the treatment options, nowadays pediatric mortality was dramatically reduced. In any case, the main obstacle to treat CF is to predict the drug response of patients due to genetic complexity and heterogeneity. Advances in 3D culture systems have led to the extrapolation of disease modeling and individual drug response in vitro by producing mini organs called ""organoids"" easily obtained from nasal and rectal mucosa biopsies. In this review, we focus primarily on patient-derived intestinal organoids used as in vitro model for CF disease. Organoids combine high-validity of outcomes with a high throughput, thus enabling CF disease classification, drug development and treatment optimization in a personalized manner.",36670555,PMC9856584,10.3390/children10010004,,2022,"Conti J, Sorio C, Melotti P.",Y,MED
It Takes Two to Tango! Protein-Protein Interactions behind cAMP-Mediated CFTR Regulation.,"Over the last fifteen years, with the approval of the first molecular treatments, a breakthrough era has begun for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the rare genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). These molecules, known as CFTR modulators, have led to unprecedented improvements in the lung function and quality of life of most CF patients. However, the efficacy of these drugs is still suboptimal, and the clinical response is highly variable even among individuals bearing the same mutation. Furthermore, not all patients carrying rare CFTR mutations are eligible for CFTR modulator therapies, indicating the need for alternative and/or add-on therapeutic approaches. Because the second messenger 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) represents the primary trigger for CFTR activation and a major regulator of different steps of the life cycle of the channel, there is growing interest in devising ways to fine-tune the cAMP signaling pathway for therapeutic purposes. This review article summarizes current knowledge regarding the role of cAMP signalosomes, i.e., multiprotein complexes bringing together key enzymes of the cAMP pathway, in the regulation of CFTR function, and discusses how modulating this signaling cascade could be leveraged for therapeutic intervention in CF.",37445715,PMC10341646,10.3390/ijms241310538,,2023,"Murabito A, Bhatt J, Ghigo A.",Y,MED
Lumacaftor/ivacaftor in cystic fibrosis: effects on glucose metabolism and insulin secretion.,"Purpose: The question whether the new cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator drugs aimed at restoring CFTR protein function might improve glucose metabolism is gaining attention, but data on the effect of lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment (LUMA/IVA) on glucose tolerance are limited. We evaluated the variation in glucose metabolism and insulin secretion in CF patients homozygous for Phe508del CFTR mutation after one-year treatment with LUMA/IVA in comparison to patients with the same genotype who did not receive such treatment.Methods: We performed a retrospective case-control study on 13 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CF, homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation, who received LUMA/IVA for one year (cases) and 13 patients with identical genotype who did not receive this treatment (controls). At the beginning and conclusion of the follow-up, all subjects received a modified 3 h OGTT, sampling at baseline, and at 30 min intervals for plasma glucose, serum insulin, and c-peptide concentrations to evaluate glucose tolerance, and quantify by modeling beta-cell insulin secretion responsiveness to glucose, insulin clearance and insulin sensitivity.Results: LUMA/IVA did not produce differences in glucose tolerance, insulin secretory parameters, clearance and sensitivity with respect to matched controls over one-year follow-up.Conclusion: We found no evidence of improvements in glucose tolerance mechanisms in patients with CF after one-year treatment with LUMA/IVA.",33586024,PMC8421269,10.1007/s40618-021-01525-4,,2021,"Colombo C, Foppiani A, Bisogno A, Gambazza S, Daccò V, Nazzari E, Leone A, Giana A, Mari A, Battezzati A.",Y,MED
The Potential Causes of Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (*CFTR*). Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common comorbidity, affecting more than 50% of adult CF patients. Despite this high prevalence, the etiology of CFRD remains incompletely understood. Studies in young CF children show pancreatic islet disorganization, abnormal glucose tolerance, and delayed first-phase insulin secretion suggesting that islet dysfunction is an early feature of CF. Since insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells express very low levels of CFTR, CFRD likely results from β-cell extrinsic factors. In the vicinity of β-cells, CFTR is expressed in both the exocrine pancreas and the immune system. In the exocrine pancreas, CFTR mutations lead to the obstruction of the pancreatic ductal canal, inflammation, and immune cell infiltration, ultimately causing the destruction of the exocrine pancreas and remodeling of islets. Both inflammation and ductal cells have a direct effect on insulin secretion and could participate in CFRD development. CFTR mutations are also associated with inflammatory responses and excessive cytokine production by various immune cells, which infiltrate the pancreas and exert a negative impact on insulin secretion, causing dysregulation of glucose homeostasis in CF adults. In addition, the function of macrophages in shaping pancreatic islet development may be impaired by CFTR mutations, further contributing to the pancreatic islet structural defects as well as impaired first-phase insulin secretion observed in very young children. This review discusses the different factors that may contribute to CFRD.",34394004,PMC8361832,10.3389/fendo.2021.702823,,2021,"Coderre L, Debieche L, Plourde J, Rabasa-Lhoret R, Lesage S.",Y,MED
Preclinical evaluation of the epithelial sodium channel inhibitor AZD5634 and implications on human translation.,"Airway dehydration causes mucus stasis and bacterial overgrowth in cystic fibrosis (CF), resulting in recurrent respiratory infections and exacerbations. Strategies to rehydrate airway mucus including inhibition of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) have the potential to improve mucosal defense by enhancing mucociliary clearance (MCC) and reducing the risk of progressive decline in lung function. In the current work, we evaluated the effects of AZD5634, an ENaC inhibitor that shows extended lung retention and safety profile as compared with previously evaluated candidate drugs, in healthy and CF preclinical model systems. We found that AZD5634 elicited a potent inhibition of amiloride-sensitive current in non-CF airway cells and airway cells derived from F508del-homozygous individuals with CF that effectively increased airway surface liquid volume and improved mucociliary transport (MCT) rate. AZD5634 also demonstrated efficacious inhibition of ENaC in sheep bronchial epithelial cells, translating to dose-dependent improvement of mucus clearance in healthy sheep in vivo. Conversely, nebulization of AZD5634 did not notably improve airway hydration or MCT in CF rats that exhibit an MCC defect, consistent with findings from a first single-dose evaluation of AZD5634 on MCC in people with CF. Overall, these findings suggest that CF animal models demonstrating impaired mucus clearance translatable to the human situation may help to successfully predict and promote the successful translation of ENaC-directed therapies to the clinic.",36098422,PMC9602792,10.1152/ajplung.00454.2021,,2022,"Åstrand A, Libby EF, Shei RJ, Lever JEP, Kaza N, Adewale AT, Boitet E, Edwards L, Hemmerling M, Root J, Lindberg B, Wingren C, Malmgren A, Sabater J, Rowe SM.",Y,MED
Cross-talk between CFTR and sphingolipids in cystic fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited, life-limiting disorder in Caucasian populations. It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which lead to an impairment of protein expression and/or function. CFTR is a chloride/bicarbonate channel expressed at the apical surface of epithelial cells of different organs. Nowadays, more than 2100 CFTR genetic variants have been described, but not all of them cause CF. However, around 80-85% of the patients worldwide are characterized by the presence, at least in one allele, of the mutation F508del. CFTR mutations cause aberrant hydration and secretion of mucus in hollow organs. In the lungs, this condition favors bacterial colonization, allowing the development of chronic infections that lead to the onset of the CF lung disease, which is the main cause of death in patients. In recent years, evidence has reported that CFTR loss of function is responsible for alterations in a particular class of bioactive lipids, called sphingolipids (SL). SL are ubiquitously present in eukaryotic cells and are mainly asymmetrically located within the external leaflet of the plasma membrane, where they organize specific platforms capable of segregating a selected number of proteins. CFTR is associated with these platforms that are fundamental for its functioning. Considering the importance of SL in CFTR homeostasis, we attempt here to provide a critical overview of the literature to determine the role of these lipids in channel stability and activity, and whether their modulation in CF could be a target for new therapeutic approaches.",37315117,PMC10476574,10.1002/2211-5463.13660,,2023,"Dobi D, Loberto N, Bassi R, Pistocchi A, Lunghi G, Tamanini A, Aureli M.",Y,MED
Effectiveness and Safety of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Modulators in Children With Cystic Fibrosis: A Meta-Analysis.,"Background and aim: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that is difficult to treat and caused by dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Small molecules have been used to treat the symptom caused by CFTR mutations by restoring CFTR protein function. However, the data on children with CF are scarce. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this therapy in children diagnosed with CF.Materials and methods: Relevant studies were identified through searching medical databases before April 1, 2022. The primary outcomes of ppFEV1, lung clearance index2.5 (LCI2.5), sweat chloride concentration (SwCI), and Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) score were pooled and analyzed. The secondary outcomes were nutritional status (weight, BMI, stature, and their z-score) and adverse events under therapy.Results: A total of twelve studies were included. Compared with the placebo group, the pooled outcome of the ppFEV1, LCI2.5, SwCI, and CFQ-R score were improved by 7.91 {[95% confidence interval (CI), 3.71-12.12], -1.00 (95% CI, -1.38 to -0.63), -35.22 (95% CI, -55.51 to -14.92), and 4.45 (95% CI, 2.31-6.59), respectively}. Compared with the placebo group, the pooled result of the change in weight was improved by 1.53 (95% CI, 0.42-2.63). All the aforementioned results were also improved in single-arm studies. No clear differences in adverse events were found between CFTR modulator therapy and the placebo group.Conclusion: CFTR modulators could improve multiaspect function in children with CF and result in comparable adverse events.",35844763,PMC9276987,10.3389/fped.2022.937250,,2022,"Li Q, Liu S, Ma X, Yu J.",Y,MED
CFTR Modulators Dampen *Aspergillus*-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species Production by Cystic Fibrosis Phagocytes.,"Excessive inflammation by phagocytes during *Aspergillus fumigatus* infection is thought to promote lung function decline in CF patients. CFTR modulators have been shown to reduce *A. fumigatus* colonization *in vivo*, however, their antifungal and anti-inflammatory mechanisms are unclear. Other treatments including azithromycin and acebilustat may dampen *Aspergillus*-induced inflammation due to their immunomodulatory properties. Therefore, we set out in this study to determine the effects of current CF therapies on ROS production and fungal killing, either direct or indirect by enhancing antifungal immune mechanisms in peripheral blood immune cells from CF patients upon *A. fumigatus* infection. Isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) from CF patients and healthy volunteers were challenged with *A. fumigatus* following pre-treatment with CFTR modulators, azithromycin or acebilustat. Ivacaftor/lumacaftor treated CF and control subject PMNs resulted in a significant reduction (*p* < 0.05) in *Aspergillus*-induced ROS. For CF PBMC, *Aspergillus*-induced ROS was significantly reduced when pre-treated with ivacaftor alone (*p* < 0.01) or in combination with lumacaftor (*p* < 0.01), with a comparable significant reduction in control subject PBMC (*p* < 0.05). Azithromycin and acebilustat had no effect on ROS production by CF or control subject phagocytes. None of the treatments showed an indirect or direct antifungal activity. In summary, CFTR modulators have potential for additional immunomodulatory benefits to prevent or treat *Aspergillus*-induced inflammation in CF. The comparable effects of CFTR modulators observed in phagocytes from control subjects questions their exact mechanism of action.",32793514,PMC7393064,10.3389/fcimb.2020.00372,,2020,"Currie AJ, Main ET, Wilson HM, Armstrong-James D, Warris A.",Y,MED
Prevalence and Determinants of Wheezing and Bronchodilatation in Children With Cystic Fibrosis: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Background: Many patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) wheeze, and are dubbed as having CF-asthma. Understanding the determinants of such wheezing may avoid unnecessary treatments and open newer treatment avenues.Objectives: Main: To evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of wheezing and a positive bronchodilatory response (BDR) in children with CF. Secondary: To identify the predictive markers and the impact of current wheezing a positive BDR.Methods: A retrospective single-center study in children with CF. We determined the characteristics of physician-reported wheeze in patients <6 years, and a BDR in patients aged 6-17 years. Anthropometric, lung function, laboratory, genetic and microbiological data were recorded in all groups. Variables were compared using the Chi2 and Student *t*-tests, and ANOVA.Results: 125 preschool and 69 school-aged children and adolescents with CF were included in the study. 71.2% of patients <6 years of age had had at least one episode of wheezing: 26.3% of patients were Transient Early Wheezers, 12.6% Late Onset Wheezers and 37.9% were Persistent Wheezers. The prevalence of a positive BDR was 73.5, 48.5, and 52.9% in the 6-8 years, 10-12 years, and 15-17 years age groups, respectively. Allergic factors were not predictive of wheezing in preschoolers. In the 6-8 years age group, the sum of wheal diameters of allergic skin prick tests (SPT, house dust mite + cat + dog dander) was greater in those with a BDR vs. no BDR (4 [2.0-8.8] vs. 1 [0-7.0] mm, *p* = 0.01). The presence of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* in the bronchial secretions before 3 years of age was not significantly associated with either the presence of wheezing at the age of 6 years or a BDR in school-aged children and adolescents. The proportion of homozygous p.F508del patients was significantly lower in the group of patients who had wheezed by 6 years of age (60% vs. 72.7%, *p* = 0.009), but higher in the 6-8 years old group with a BDR vs. no BDR (64% vs. 36%, *p* = 0.04). Current wheezers at 6 years had a lower mean FEV1 vs. the non-current wheezers (91.5 ± 4.4% vs. 100.9 ± 2.4%; *p* = 0.047). Similarly, forced vital capacity (FVC) was significantly lower in the 6-8 years old group with BDR vs. no BDR (85 ± 19 vs. 101 ± 21%, *p* = 0.015).Conclusion: Wheezing and BDR are very frequent findings in children with CF. Current wheeze at the age of 6 years was associated with worse lung function. Labeling wheezing in CF as ""CF-Asthma"" is misleading since the determinants are different, and may lead to inappropriate prescriptions of inhaled steroids.",35633979,PMC9133441,10.3389/fped.2022.856840,,2022,"Galodé F, Ladipo O, Andrieux A, Feghali H, Bui S, Fayon M.",Y,MED
Chronic rhinosinusitis in cystic fibrosis: a review of therapeutic options.,"Purpose: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is observed in almost 100% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF-related CRS treatment is extremely challenging because of the underlying genetic defect leading to its development. CRS in CF is often refractory to standard therapy, while recurrences after surgical treatment are inevitable in the majority of patients. This study provides a precise review of the current knowledge regarding possible therapeutic options for CF-related CRS.Methods: The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using the terms ""cystic fibrosis"" in conjunction with ""otorhinolaryngological manifestation"", ""rhinology"" and ""sinusitis"".Results: Precise guidelines for CF-induced CRS therapy are lacking due to the lack of large cohort randomized controlled trials. None of the existing therapeutic agents has already been recommended for CRS in CF. Therapy targeting the underlying genetic defect, intranasal dornase alfa administration, and topical delivery of colistin and tobramycin showed promising results in CF-related CRS therapy. Besides the potential effectiveness of nasal steroids, strong recommendations for their usage in CF have not been provided yet. Systemic corticosteroid usage is controversial due to its potential negative influence on pulmonary disease. Ibuprofen revealed some positive effects on CF-related CRS in molecular and small cohort studies. Intranasal irrigation with saline solutions could relieve sinonasal symptoms. Nasal decongestants are not recommended. Endoscopic sinus surgery is the first-line surgical option for refractory CRS. Extensive surgical approaches should be considered as they could improve long-term outcomes in CRS.Conclusion: Further studies are warranted to establish consensus for CF-related CRS therapy.",34296343,PMC8739462,10.1007/s00405-021-06875-6,,2022,"Krajewska J, Zub K, Słowikowski A, Zatoński T.",Y,MED

The search for a drug might be additionally complicated due to the diverse clinical picture and lack of a unified definition of CFLD. Although ursodeoxycholic acid has been used for decades, its efficacy in CFLD is controversial, and the potential of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) modulators and targeted gene therapy in CFLD needs to be defined in the near future.

A pilot study of cystic fibrosis exacerbation response phenotypes reveals contrasting serum and sputum iron trends.,"The cystic fibrosis (CF) community seeks to explain heterogeneous outcomes of pulmonary exacerbation (PEX) treatment. Serum and sputum inflammatory mediators may identify people with CF (PwCF) at risk for suboptimal responses. However, lack of an established association between response phenotypes and these mediators limits clinical application. In this pilot study, we prospectively characterized treatment response phenotypes by assessing health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) during PEX. We also measured lung function and iron-related biochemical parameters in serum and sputum. We classified subjects as sustained symptom-responders (SRs) or non-sustained symptom-responders (NSRs) based on the absence or presence, respectively, of worsened symptom scores after initial improvement. We used linear mixed models (LMMs) to determine whether trends in lung function, hematologic, serum, and sputum indices of inflammation differed between response cohorts. In 20 PwCF, we identified 10 SRs and 10 NSRs with no significant differences in lung function at PEX onset and treatment durations. SRs had better model-predicted trends in lung function than NSRs during PEX. Non-linear trends in serum and sputum iron levels significantly differed between SRs and NSRs. In adults with cystic fibrosis, PEX treatment response phenotypes may be correlated with distinctive trends in serum and sputum iron concentrations.",33649353,PMC7921142,10.1038/s41598-021-84041-y,,2021,"Gifford AH, Polineni D, He J, D'Amico JL, Dorman DB, Williams MA, Nymon AB, Balwan A, Budden T, Zuckerman JB.",Y,MED

We present an integrated *in vivo, in silico* and *in vitro* investigation of an individual with CF carrying the rare Q1291H*-CFTR* allele and the common F508del allele. At age 56 years, the participant had obstructive lung disease and bronchiectasis, qualifying for Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI) CFTR modulator treatment due to their F508del allele. Q1291H *CFTR* incurs a splicing defect, producing both a normally spliced but mutant mRNA isoform and a misspliced isoform with a premature termination codon, causing nonsense mediated decay. The effectiveness of ETI in restoring Q1291H-CFTR is largely unknown. **Methods:** We collected clinical endpoint measurements, including forced expiratory volume in 1 s percent predicted (FEV1pp) and body mass index (BMI), and examined medical history. *In silico* simulations of the Q1291H-CFTR were compared to Q1291R, G551D, and wild-type (WT)-CFTR. We quantified relative Q1291H *CFTR* mRNA isoform abundance in patient-derived nasal epithelial cells. Differentiated pseudostratified airway epithelial cell models at air liquid interface were created and ETI treatment impact on CFTR was assessed by electrophysiology assays and Western blot. **Results:** The participant ceased ETI treatment after 3 months due to adverse events and no improvement in FEV1pp or BMI. *In silico* simulations of Q1291H-CFTR identified impairment of ATP binding similar to known gating mutants Q1291R and G551D-CFTR. Q1291H and F508del mRNA transcripts composed 32.91% and 67.09% of total mRNA respectively, indicating 50.94% of Q1291H mRNA was misspliced and degraded. Mature Q1291H-CFTR protein expression was reduced (3.18% ± 0.60% of WT/WT) and remained unchanged with ETI. Baseline CFTR activity was minimal (3.45 ± 0.25 μA/cm2) and not enhanced with ETI (5.73 ± 0.48 μA/cm2), aligning with the individual's clinical evaluation as a non-responder to ETI. **Conclusion:** The combination of *in silico* simulations and *in vitro* theratyping in patient-derived cell models can effectively assess CFTR modulator efficacy for individuals with non-classical CF manifestations or rare *CFTR* mutations, guiding personalized treatment strategies and optimizing clinical outcomes.",37325471,PMC10267335,10.3389/fmolb.2023.1148501,,2023,"Allan KM, Astore MA, Kardia E, Wong SL, Fawcett LK, Bell JL, Visser S, Chen PC, Griffith R, Jaffe A, Sivam S, Vittorio O, Kuyucak S, Waters SA.",Y,MED
"Lumacaftor-ivacaftor in the treatment of cystic fibrosis: design, development and place in therapy.","Lumacaftor-ivacaftor is a combination of two small molecule therapies targeting the basic defect in cystic fibrosis (CF) at a cellular level. It is a precision medicine and its effects are specific to individuals with two copies of the p.Phe508del gene mutation. The drug combination works by restoring functioning CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein in cell surface membranes and was the first CFTR modulator licensed for the homozygous p.Phe508del genotype. The drug is a combination of a CFTR corrector and potentiator. Lumacaftor, the corrector, works by increasing the trafficking of CFTR proteins to the outer cell membrane. Ivacaftor, the potentiator, works by enabling the opening of what would otherwise be a dysfunctional chloride channel. In vivo lumacaftor-ivacaftor improves Phe508del-CFTR activity in airways, sweat ducts and intestine to approximately 10-20% of normal CFTR function with greater reductions in sweat chloride levels in children versus adults. Its use results in a modest improvement in lung function and a decreased rate of subsequent decline. Perhaps more importantly, those treated report increased levels of well-being and their rate of respiratory exacerbations is significantly improved. This review traces the development and use of this combination of CFTR modulators, the first licensed drug for treating the homozygous p.Phe508del CF genotype at the intracellular level by correcting the protein defect.",31409974,PMC6650604,10.2147/dddt.s153719,,2019,Connett GJ.,Y,MED
A small molecule CFTR potentiator restores ATP-dependent channel gating to the cystic fibrosis mutant G551D-CFTR.,"Background and purpose: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiators are small molecules developed to treat the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). They interact directly with CFTR Cl- channels at the plasma membrane to enhance channel gating. Here, we investigate the action of a new CFTR potentiator, CP-628006 with a distinct chemical structure.Experimental approach: Using electrophysiological assays with CFTR-expressing heterologous cells and CF patient-derived human bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells, we compared the effects of CP-628006 with the marketed CFTR potentiator ivacaftor.Key results: CP-628006 efficaciously potentiated CFTR function in epithelia from cultured hBE cells. Its effects on the predominant CFTR variant F508del-CFTR were larger than those with the gating variant G551D-CFTR. In excised inside-out membrane patches, CP-628006 potentiated wild-type, F508del-CFTR, and G551D-CFTR by increasing the frequency and duration of channel openings. CP-628006 increased the affinity and efficacy of F508del-CFTR gating by ATP. In these respects, CP-628006 behaved like ivacaftor. CP-628006 also demonstrated notable differences with ivacaftor. Its potency and efficacy were lower than those of ivacaftor. CP-628006 conferred ATP-dependent gating on G551D-CFTR, whereas the action of ivacaftor was ATP-independent. For G551D-CFTR, but not F508del-CFTR, the action of CP-628006 plus ivacaftor was greater than ivacaftor alone. CP-628006 delayed, but did not prevent, the deactivation of F508del-CFTR at the plasma membrane, whereas ivacaftor accentuated F508del-CFTR deactivation.Conclusions and implications: CP-628006 has distinct effects compared to ivacaftor, suggesting a different mechanism of CFTR potentiation. The emergence of CFTR potentiators with diverse modes of action makes therapy with combinations of potentiators a possibility.",34644413,PMC9304199,10.1111/bph.15709,,2022,"Liu J, Berg AP, Wang Y, Jantarajit W, Sutcliffe KJ, Stevens EB, Cao L, Pregel MJ, Sheppard DN.",Y,MED

Anticipating New Treatments for Cystic Fibrosis: A Global Survey of Researchers.,"Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening disease that affects at least 100,000 people worldwide. It is caused by a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene and presently, 360 CFTR-causing mutations have been identified. Since the discovery of the CFTR gene, the expectation of developing treatments that can substantially increase the quality of life or even cure cystic fibrosis patients is growing. Yet, it is still uncertain today which developing treatments will be successful against cystic fibrosis. This study addresses this gap by assessing the opinions of over 524 cystic fibrosis researchers who participated in a global web-based survey. For most respondents, CFTR modulator therapies are the most likely to succeed in treating cystic fibrosis in the next 15 years, especially through the use of CFTR modulator combinations. Most respondents also believe that fixing or replacing the CFTR gene will lead to a cure for cystic fibrosis within 15 years, with CRISPR-Cas9 being the most likely genetic tool for this purpose.",35268374,PMC8911007,10.3390/jcm11051283,,2022,"Cabral B, Terlizzi V, Laselva O, Conte Filho C, Mota F.",Y,MED
Colistin dry powder inhalation with the Twincer™: An effective and more patient friendly alternative to nebulization.,"Background: Nebulization of antimicrobial drugs such as tobramycin and colistin is a cornerstone in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, nebulization has a high treatment burden. The Twincer™ is a dry powder inhaler specifically developed for the inhalation of antibiotics such as colistin. The aim of this study was to compare patient outcomes and experience with colistin dry powder by the Twincer with nebulization of colistin or tobramycin in adult CF patients in a real-life setting.Methods: This was a retrospective study from 01-01-2015 until 01-07-2018. Effectiveness was evaluated by comparing FEV1 decline and exacerbation rate during a mean of 4.1 years of nebulization therapy prior to the initiation of the Twincer against the same values during a mean of 1.7 years of treatment with the Twincer.Results: Twenty-one patients were evaluated, of whom twelve could be included in the effectiveness analysis, with a total of twenty patient years. Of all patients 71.4% preferred therapy with the Twincer over nebulization. Twincer use resulted in high treatment adherence with an average adherence rate of 92.5%. There was no significant difference in annual decline in FEV1%pred prior to and after start changing from nebulization to the use of the Twincer powder inhaler (median decline -1.56 [-5.57-5.31] and 1.35 [-8.45-6.36]) respectively, p = 0.45 (linear mixed effect model)). No significant difference was found in the number of intravenous or combined total intravenous and oral antibiotic courses during Twincer therapy compared to when using nebulization (1.68 and 2.49 courses during Twincer therapy versus 1.51 and 2.94 courses during nebulization, p = 0.88 and p = 0.63).Conclusion: Colistin dry powder inhalation with the Twincer is a more patient friendly alternative to nebulization, and we did not observe significant differences in the clinical outcome, regarding lung function and exacerbation rates.",32970760,PMC7514010,10.1371/journal.pone.0239658,,2020,"Akkerman-Nijland AM, Grasmeijer F, Kerstjens HAM, Frijlink HW, van der Vaart H, Vonk JM, Hagedoorn P, Rottier BL, Koppelman GH, Akkerman OW.",Y,MED

The clinical impact of the Covid-19 pandemic first wave on patients with cystic fibrosis in New York.,"Background: People with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) may be at risk of complications from COVID-19 but the impact of COVID-19 on pwCF remains unknown.Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic first wave on pwCF in the New York metropolitan area (NY) from March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020. Objectives were to determine (1) the prevalence of COVID-19 by PCR and IgG antibody testing, (2) the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, (3) delay in routine outpatient care, and (4) the effect on anxiety and depression in pwCF.Results: There were 26 COVID-19 cases diagnosed by PCR or antibody testing among the study cohort of 810 pwCF. The prevalence of COVID-19 by PCR (1.6%) and IgG antibody (12.2%) testing was low. 58% of cases were asymptomatic and 82% were managed at home. 8% were hospitalized and 1 person died. 89% of pwCF experienced delay in care. The prevalence of anxiety increased from 43% baseline to 58% during the pandemic (P<0.01). In post-hoc analysis, the proportion of patients with diabetes (38% versus 16%, P<0.01) and pancreatic insufficiency (96% versus 66%, P<0.01) were higher while CFTR modulator use was lower (46% versus 65%, P = 0.05) in pwCF who tested positive for COVID-19.Conclusions: The prevalence of COVID-19 among pwCF in NY during the pandemic first wave was low and most cases were managed at home.

"Testing the effects of combining azithromycin with inhaled tobramycin for *P. aeruginosa* in cystic fibrosis: a randomised, controlled clinical trial.","Rationale: Inhaled tobramycin and oral azithromycin are common chronic therapies in people with cystic fibrosis and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* airway infection. Some studies have shown that azithromycin can reduce the ability of tobramycin to kill *P. aeruginosa*. This trial was done to test the effects of combining azithromycin with inhaled tobramycin on clinical and microbiological outcomes in people already using inhaled tobramycin. We theorised that those randomised to placebo (no azithromycin) would have greater improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and greater reduction in *P. aeruginosa* sputum in response to tobramycin.Methods: A 6-week prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial testing oral azithromycin versus placebo combined with clinically prescribed inhaled tobramycin in individuals with cystic fibrosis and *P. aeruginosa* airway infection.Results: Over a 6-week period, including 4 weeks of inhaled tobramycin, the relative change in FEV1 did not statistically significantly differ between groups (azithromycin (n=56) minus placebo (n=52) difference: 3.44%; 95% CI: -0.48 to 7.35; p=0.085). Differences in secondary clinical outcomes, including patient-reported symptom scores, weight and need for additional antibiotics, did not significantly differ. Among the 29 azithromycin and 35 placebo participants providing paired sputum samples, the 6-week change in *P. aeruginosa* density differed in favour of the placebo group (difference: 0.75 log10 CFU/mL; 95% CI: 0.03 to 1.47; p=0.043).Conclusions: Despite having greater reduction in *P. aeruginosa* density in participants able to provide sputum samples, participants randomised to placebo with inhaled tobramycin did not experience significantly greater improvements in lung function or other clinical outcomes compared with those randomised to azithromycin with tobramycin.",34706982,PMC9043040,10.1136/thoraxjnl-2021-217782,,2022,"Nichols DP, Singh PK, Baines A, Caverly LJ, Chmiel JF, GIbson RL, Lascano J, Morgan SJ, Retsch-Bogart G, Saiman L, Sadeghi H, Billings JL, Heltshe SL, Kirby S, Kong A, Nick JA, Mayer-Hamblett N, TEACH Study Group.",Y,MED
Induced pluripotent stem cell-based therapies for organ fibrosis.,"Fibrotic diseases result in organ remodelling and dysfunctional failure and account for one-third of all deaths worldwide. There are no ideal treatments that can halt or reverse progressive organ fibrosis, moreover, organ transplantation is complicated by problems with a limited supply of donor organs and graft rejection. The development of new approaches, especially induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based therapy, is becoming a hot topic due to their ability to self-renew and differentiate into different cell types that may replace the fibrotic organs. In the past decade, studies have differentiated iPSCs into fibrosis-relevant cell types which were demonstrated to have anti-fibrotic effects that may have the potential to inform new effective precision treatments for organ-specific fibrosis. In this review, we summarize the potential of iPSC-based cellular approaches as therapeutic avenues for treating organ fibrosis, the advantages and disadvantages of iPSCs compared with other types of stem cell-based therapies, as well as the challenges and future outlook in this field.",37274156,PMC10232908,10.3389/fbioe.2023.1119606,,2023,"Cheng W, Fan C, Song Q, Chen P, Peng H, Lin L, Liu C, Wang B, Zhou Z.",Y,MED

A Novel Co-Culture Model Reveals Enhanced CFTR Rescue in Primary Cystic Fibrosis Airway Epithelial Cultures with Persistent *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* Infection.,"People with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) suffer from chronic and recurring bacterial lung infections that begin very early in life and contribute to progressive lung failure. CF is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene, which encodes an ion channel important for maintaining the proper hydration of pulmonary surfaces. When CFTR function is ablated or impaired, airways develop thickened, adherent mucus that contributes to a vicious cycle of infection and inflammation. Therapeutics for pwCF, called CFTR modulators, target the CFTR defect directly, restoring airway surface hydration and mucociliary clearance. However, even with CFTR modulator therapy, bacterial infections persist. To develop a relevant model of diseased airway epithelium, we established a primary human airway epithelium culture system with persistent *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infection. We used this model to examine the effects of CFTR modulators on CFTR maturation, CFTR function, and bacterial persistence. We found that the presence of *P. aeruginosa* increased CFTR mRNA, protein, and function. We also found that CFTR modulators caused a decrease in *P. aeruginosa* burden. These results demonstrate the importance of including live bacteria to accurately model the CF lung, and that understanding the effects of infection on CFTR rescue by CFTR modulators is critical to evaluating and optimizing drug therapies for all pwCF.",37998353,PMC10670530,10.3390/cells12222618,,2023,"Cholon DM, Greenwald MA, Higgs MG, Quinney NL, Boyles SE, Meinig SL, Minges JT, Chaubal A, Tarran R, Ribeiro CMP, Wolfgang MC, Gentzsch M.",Y,MED
"Targeting fibrosis, mechanisms and cilinical trials.","Fibrosis is characterized by the excessive extracellular matrix deposition due to dysregulated wound and connective tissue repair response. Multiple organs can develop fibrosis, including the liver, kidney, heart, and lung. Fibrosis such as liver cirrhosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and cystic fibrosis caused substantial disease burden. Persistent abnormal activation of myofibroblasts mediated by various signals, such as transforming growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and fibroblast growh factor, has been recongized as a major event in the occurrence and progression of fibrosis. Although the mechanisms driving organ-specific fibrosis have not been fully elucidated, drugs targeting these identified aberrant signals have achieved potent anti-fibrotic efficacy in clinical trials. In this review, we briefly introduce the aetiology and epidemiology of several fibrosis diseases, including liver fibrosis, kidney fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, and pulmonary fibrosis. Then, we summarise the abnormal cells (epithelial cells, endothelial cells, immune cells, and fibroblasts) and their interactions in fibrosis. In addition, we also focus on the aberrant signaling pathways and therapeutic targets that regulate myofibroblast activation, extracellular matrix cross-linking, metabolism, and inflammation in fibrosis. Finally, we discuss the anti-fibrotic drugs based on their targets and clinical trials.

Crosslink between SARS-CoV-2 replication and cystic fibrosis hallmarks.,"SARS-CoV-2, the etiological cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, can cause severe illness in certain at-risk populations, including people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). Nevertheless, several studies indicated that pwCF do not have higher risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection nor do they demonstrate worse clinical outcomes than those of the general population. Recent *in vitro* studies indicate cellular and molecular processes to be significant drivers in pwCF lower infection rates and milder symptoms than expected in cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These range from cytokine releases to biochemical alterations leading to morphological rearrangements inside the cells associated with CFTR impairment. Based on available data, the reported low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among pwCF is likely a result of several variables linked to CFTR dysfunction, such as thick mucus, IL-6 reduction, altered ACE2 and TMPRSS2 processing and/or functioning, defective anions exchange, and autophagosome formation. An extensive analysis of the relation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and pwCF is essential to elucidate the mechanisms involved in this lower-than-expected infection impact and to possibly suggest potential new antiviral strategies.",37250046,PMC10213757,10.3389/fmicb.2023.1162470,,2023,"Lotti V, Lagni A, Diani E, Sorio C, Gibellini D.",Y,MED

Iron Deficiency in Cystic Fibrosis: A Cross-Sectional Single-Centre Study in a Referral Adult Centre.,"Iron deficiency (ID) diagnosis in cystic fibrosis (CF) is challenging because of frequent systemic inflammation. We aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of ID in adult patients with CF. We conducted a single-centre prospective study in a referral centre. ID was defined by transferrin saturation ≤16% or ferritin ≤20 (women) or 30 (men) μg/L, or ≤100 μg/L in the case of systemic inflammation. Apparent exacerbation was an exclusion criterion. We included 165 patients (78 women), mean age—31.1 ± 8.9 years. ID prevalence was 44.2%.

"Mucus Structure, Viscoelastic Properties, and Composition in Chronic Respiratory Diseases.","The respiratory mucus, a viscoelastic gel, effectuates a primary line of the airway defense when operated by the mucociliary clearance. In chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs), such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF), the mucus is overproduced and its solid content augments, changing its structure and viscoelastic properties and determining a derangement of essential defense mechanisms against opportunistic microbial (virus and bacteria) pathogens. This ensues in damaging of the airways, leading to a vicious cycle of obstruction and infection responsible for the harsh clinical evolution of these CRDs. Here, we review the essential features of normal and pathological mucus (i.e., sputum in CF, COPD, and asthma), i.e., mucin content, structure (mesh size), micro/macro-rheology, pH, and osmotic pressure, ending with the awareness that sputum biomarkers (mucins, inflammatory proteins and peptides, and metabolites) might serve to indicate acute exacerbation and response to therapies. There are some indications that old and novel treatments may change the structure, viscoelastic properties, and biomarker content of sputum; however, a wealth of work is still needed to embrace these measures as correlates of disease severity in association with (or even as substitutes of) pulmonary functional tests.",38339210,PMC10856136,10.3390/ijms25031933,,2024,"Abrami M, Biasin A, Tescione F, Tierno D, Dapas B, Carbone A, Grassi G, Conese M, Di Gioia S, Larobina D, Grassi M.",Y,MED
Lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy is associated with reduced hepatic steatosis in cystic fibrosis patients.,"Background: Hepatic steatosis is a common form of cystic fibrosis associated liver disease (CFLD) seen in an estimated 15%-60% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The pathophysiology and health implications of hepatic steatosis in cystic fibrosis remain largely unknown. In the general population, hepatic steatosis is strongly associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) impacts 40%-50% of CF adults and is characterized by both insulin insufficiency and insulin resistance. We hypothesized that patients with CFRD would have higher levels of hepatic steatosis than cystic fibrosis patients without diabetes.Aim: To determine whether CFRD is associated with hepatic steatosis and to explore the impact of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy on hepatic steatosis in CF.Methods: Thirty patients with CF were recruited from a tertiary care medical center for this cross-sectional study. Only pancreatic insufficient patients with CFRD or normal glucose tolerance (NGT) were included. Patients with established CFLD, end stage lung disease, or persistently elevated liver enzymes were excluded. Mean magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) proton density fat fraction (PDFF) was obtained for all participants. Clinical characteristics [age, sex, body mass index, percent predicted forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV1), lumacaftor/ivacaftor use] and blood chemistries were assessed for possible association with hepatic steatosis. Hepatic steatosis was defined as a mean MRI PDFF > 5%. Patients were grouped by diabetes status (CFRD, NGT) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator use (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, no lumacaftor/ivacaftor) to determine between group differences. Continuous variables were analyzed with a Wilcoxon rank sum test and discrete variables with a Chi square test or Fisher's exact test.Results: Twenty subjects were included in the final analysis. The median age was 22.3 years (11.3-39.0) and median FEV1 was 77% (33%-105%). Twelve subjects had CFRD and 8 had NGT. Nine subjects were receiving lumacaftor/ivacaftor. The median PDFF was 3.0% (0.0%-21.0%). Six subjects (30%) had hepatic steatosis defined as PDFF > 5%. Hepatic fat fraction was significantly lower in patients receiving lumacaftor/ivacaftor (median, range) (2.0%, 0.0%-6.4%) than in patients not receiving lumacaftor/ivacaftor (4.1%, 2.7-21.0%), *P* = 0.002. Though patients with CFRD had lower PDFF (2.2%, 0.0%-14.5%) than patients with NGT (4.9%, 2.4-21.0%) this did not reach statistical significance, *P* = 0.06. No other clinical characteristic was strongly associated with hepatic steatosis.Conclusion: Use of the CFTR modulator lumacaftor/ivacaftor was associated with significantly lower hepatic steatosis.

SLC26A9 as a Potential Modifier and Therapeutic Target in Cystic Fibrosis Lung Disease.,"SLC26A9 belongs to the solute carrier family 26 (SLC26), which comprises membrane proteins involved in ion transport mechanisms. On the basis of different preliminary findings, including the phenotype of SlC26A9-deficient mice and its possible role as a gene modifier of the human phenotype and treatment response, SLC26A9 has emerged as one of the most interesting alternative targets for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). However, despite relevant clues, some open issues and controversies remain. The lack of specific pharmacological modulators, the elusive expression reported in the airways, and its complex relationships with CFTR and the CF phenotype prevent us from conclusively understanding the contribution of SLC26A9 in human lung physiology and its real potential as a therapeutic target in CF. In this review, we summarized the various studies dealing with SLC26A9 expression, molecular structure, and function as an anion channel or transporter; its interaction and functional relationships with CFTR; and its role as a gene modifier and tried to reconcile them in order to highlight the current understanding and the gap in knowledge regarding the contribution of SLC26A9 to human lung physiology and CF disease and treatment.",35204703,PMC8961553,10.3390/biom12020202,,2022,"Gorrieri G, Zara F, Scudieri P.",Y,MED
Pendrin stimulates a chloride absorption pathway to increase CFTR-mediated chloride secretion from Cystic Fibrosis airway epithelia.,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF), an inherited multi-system disease, is caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) that disrupt its ability to secrete anions from epithelia. Recovery of functional anion secretion may be curative for CF, so different components of the ion transport machinery have become attractive therapeutic targets. Several members of the SLC26 ion transporter family have been linked to epithelial ion flux, some through putative functional interactions with CFTR. Using a small-scale qPCR screen, we confirmed that the anion transporter SLC26A4 (pendrin) is downregulated in CF. Upregulation of pendrin using interleukins IL-4 or IL-13 increased Cl- secretion through CFTR in human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) derived epithelia differentiated in vitro and measured in the Ussing Chamber. Inhibition or knockdown of pendrin prevented this increased secretion. Increased CFTR activity was not driven by increases in CFTR protein or upstream regulatory pathway components. When basolateral Cl- absorption through NKCC1 was inhibited, a pendrin-dependent Cl- absorption pathway allowing CFTR to continue secreting Cl- from the epithelium was revealed. Although CFTR is often considered the bottleneck in the transepithelial Cl- transport pathway, these studies indicate that basolateral Cl- permeability becomes limiting as CFTR activity increases. Therefore, an increase of epithelial Cl- absorption via pendrin might have additional therapeutic benefit in combination with CFTR modulators.",32923987,PMC7475303,10.1096/fba.2020-00012,,2020,"Bajko J, Duguid M, Altmann S, Hurlbut GD, Kaczmarek JS.",Y,MED

Chronic rhinosinusitis in patients with cystic fibrosis-Current management and new treatments.,"Objectives: The purpose of this article is to provide a state-of-the-art review of the literature and summarize the latest publications on medical and surgical treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), with an emphasis on describing recent advancements in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies.Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted utilizing the PubMed database with search phrases detailed within the body of the article. Abstracts were reviewed to include publications detailing medical, surgical, and CFTR modulating therapies for CF CRS. Findings from studies not previously reviewed and publications regarding CFTR modulators were emphasized.Results: No clear guidelines for treatment of CF CRS are available. Nasal saline rinses, topical steroids, topical antibiotics, and topical dornase alfa are reported medical therapies. Ivacaftor has some sinonasal symptomatic benefit. A new triple therapy CFTR modulator, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor, is capable of treating 90% of patients with CF and has shown the greatest FEV1 improvement of any CFTR modulator yet. There is no clear consensus on surgical indications or technique, though aggressive surgery in recalcitrant disease has shown some symptomatic benefit. Endoscopic sinus surgery after lung transplantation may benefit some patients in whom the sinuses serve as a reservoir for recurrent pulmonary infections by decreasing rates of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and improving 5 year survival.Conclusion: As lifespan increases for patients with CF, further investigation into medical therapy, CFTR modulator sinonasal outcomes, and surgical technique and outcomes for CF CRS is needed.Level of evidence: 5.",32596478,PMC7314487,10.1002/lio2.401,,2020,"Johnson BJ, Choby GW, O'Brien EK.",Y,MED
A uniquely efficacious type of CFTR corrector with complementary mode of action.,"Three distinct pharmacological corrector types (I, II, III) with different binding sites and additive behavior only partially rescue the F508del-cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) folding and trafficking defect observed in cystic fibrosis. We describe uniquely effective, macrocyclic CFTR correctors that were additive to the known corrector types, exerting a complementary ""type IV"" corrector mechanism. Macrocycles achieved wild-type-like folding efficiency of F508del-CFTR at the endoplasmic reticulum and normalized CFTR currents in reconstituted patient-derived bronchial epithelium. Using photo-activatable macrocycles, docking studies and site-directed mutagenesis a highly probable binding site and pose for type IV correctors was identified in a cavity between lasso helix-1 (Lh1) and transmembrane helix-1 of membrane spanning domain (MSD)-1, distinct from the known corrector binding sites. Since only F508del-CFTR fragments spanning from Lh1 until MSD2 responded to type IV correctors, these likely promote cotranslational assembly of Lh1, MSD1, and MSD2. Previously corrector-resistant CFTR folding mutants were also robustly rescued, suggesting substantial therapeutic potential for type IV correctors.",38427726,PMC11801377,10.1126/sciadv.adk1814,,2024,"Marchesin V, Monnier L, Blattmann P, Chevillard F, Kuntz C, Forny C, Kamper J, Studer R, Bossu A, Ertel EA, Nayler O, Brotschi C, Williams JT, Gatfield J.",Y,MED
Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Modulator Therapy: A Review for the Otolaryngologist.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that may result in multiple systemic disorders and potentially fatal severe respiratory compromise. However, the advent of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators has changed the management of CF for patients with select mutations. Although clinical trials have highlighted increased pulmonary function and decreased exacerbations as a result of these novel therapies, their effect on the sinuses has not been well-described.Objective: Our objective is to review the CFTR modulators to provide otolaryngologists, physicians who frequently care for patients with CF, a basic understanding of these drugs and their effects on chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in patients with CF.Methods: The clinically approved and available CFTR modulators and specific indications for their use are reviewed. Additionally, a systematic review of these therapies and effects on CRS in CF was performed.Results: Four Food and Drug Administration approved CFTR modulators are available for patients with CF. Current drugs are approved for gating, residual function, or F508del mutations. Multiple reports describe CFTR modulators' increase in transepithelial ion transport in nasal epithelial cultures; however, clinical studies regarding effects of these modulators on sinonasal health are limited to 5 studies that present new data of the effects of CFTR modulators in CRS.Conclusions: CFTR modulators have changed management of CF. Initial studies of these medications demonstrate promising results in CF; however, there is a paucity of literature describing the effect of CFTR modulators on CF-associated CRS, although initial results are encouraging.",32168995,PMC7573678,10.1177/1945892420912368,,2020,"Lee SE, Farzal Z, Daniels MLA, Thorp BD, Zanation AM, Senior BA, Ebert CS, Kimple AJ.",Y,MED
The impact of FDA and EMA regulatory decision-making process on the access to CFTR modulators for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Over the past decade, a new class of drugs called CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) modulators have shown to be able to improve clinical outcomes in patient with Cystic Fibrosis. In this analysis, we have extensively reviewed the regulatory pathways and decisions adopted by FDA and EMA to speed up the development, the review and the approval of these drugs, with the aim of identifying possible clinical and public health implications associated with differences.Results: CFTR modulators have been developed towards addressing three main genetic domains: (1) F508del homozygous (F508del/F508del), (2) F508del heterozygous, and (3) genotypes not carrying F508del mutation; and expanded from adult to paediatric population. Programs to expedite the reviewing and licensing of CFTR modulators were extensively adopted by FDA and EMA. All CFTR modulators have been licensed in the US as orphan drugs, but in the EU the orphan status for LUM/IVA was not confirmed at the time of marketing authorization as results from the pivotal trial were not considered clinically significant. While FDA and EMA approved CFTR modulators on the basis of results from phase III double-blind RCTs, main differences were found on the extension of indications: FDA accepted non-clinical evidence considering a recovery of the CFTR function ≥ 10% based on chloride transport, a reliable indicator to correlate with improvement in clinical outcomes. By contrast, EMA did not deem preclinical data sufficient to expand the label of CFTR modulators without confirmatory clinical data.Conclusions: Regulators played an important role in fostering the development and approval of CFTR modulators. However, differences were found between FDA and EMA in the way of reviewing and licensing CFTR modulators, which extended beyond semantics affecting patients' eligibility and access: FDA's approach was more mechanistic/biology-driven while the EMA's one was more oriented by clinical evidence. This might refer to the connection between the EMA and the Member States, which tends to base decisions on pricing and reimbursement on clinical data rather than pre-clinical ones. Here we have proposed a two-step personalized-based model to merge the ethical commitment of ensuring larger access to all potential eligible patients (including those harboring very rare mutations) with the one of ensuring access to clinically assessed and effective medicines through Real World Data.",35525974,PMC9078013,10.1186/s13023-022-02350-5,,2022,"Costa E, Girotti S, Pauro F, Leufkens HGM, Cipolli M.",Y,MED
Lung function in children with cystic fibrosis in the USA and UK: a comparative longitudinal analysis of national registry data.,"Rationale: A previous analysis found significantly higher lung function in the US paediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) population compared with the UK with this difference apparently decreasing in adolescence and adulthood. However, the cross-sectional nature of the study makes it hard to interpret these results.Objectives: To compare longitudinal trajectories of lung function in children with CF between the USA and UK and to explore reasons for any differences.Methods: We used mixed effects regression analysis to model lung function trajectories in the study populations. Using descriptive statistics, we compared early growth and nutrition (height, weight, body mass index), infections (*Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Staphylococcus aureus*) and treatments (rhDnase, hypertonic saline, inhaled antibiotics).Results: We included 9463 children from the USA and 3055 children from the UK with homozygous F508del genotype. Lung function was higher in the USA than in the UK when first measured at age six and remained higher throughout childhood. We did not find important differences in early growth and nutrition, or *P.aeruginosa* infection. Prescription of rhDNase and hypertonic saline was more common in the USA. Inhaled antibiotics were prescribed at similar levels in both countries, but Tobramycin was prescribed more in the USA and colistin in the UK. *S. aureus* infection was more common in the USA than the UK.Conclusions: Children with CF and homozygous F508del genotype in the USA had better lung function than UK children. These differences do not appear to be explained by early growth or nutrition, but differences in the use of early treatments need further investigation.",33975926,PMC8581063,10.1136/thoraxjnl-2021-216849,,2022,"Schlüter DK, Ostrenga JS, Carr SB, Fink AK, Faro A, Szczesniak RD, Keogh RH, Charman SC, Marshall BC, Goss CH, Taylor-Robinson D.",Y,MED
Molecular targets for cystic fibrosis and therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that affects the exocrine glands and is caused by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) mutations. Lung disease is the leading cause of morbidity in patients. Target-specific treatment of CF has been achieved using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The purpose of this article is to discuss the possibility of treating CF with mAbs through their significant target specificity. We searched electronic databases in Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Google Scholar from 1984 to 2021. We discussed the critical role of targeted therapy in cystic fibrosis, as it will be more effective at suppressing the molecular networks. After conducting a critical review of the available literature, we concluded that it is critical to understand the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying CF prior to incorporating biologics into the therapy regimen. Omalizumab, Mepolizumab, Benralizumab, Dupilumab and KB001-A have been successfully screened for asthma-complicated CF, and their efficacies have been well reported. Despite the availability of effective targeted biologics, treating CF has remained a difficult task, particularly when it comes to reduction of secondary inflammatory mediators. This review emphasizes the overall views on CF, the immunological mechanism of CF, and the prospective therapeutic use of mAbs as potential targeted biologics for enhancing the overall status of human health.",36601503,PMC9805982,10.1016/j.jsps.2022.10.002,,2022,"Moni SS, Al Basheer A.",Y,MED
Lumacaftor/ Ivacaftor improves exercise tolerance in patients with Cystic Fibrosis and severe airflow obstruction.,"Background: Treatment of patients with Cystic Fibrosis homozygous for the Phe508del gene, with Lumacaftor /Ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) improves outcomes in patients with FEV1 > 40% predicted. We set out to observe the most sensitive clinical measure that would change with treatment in terms of exercise capacity or lung function in adults with severe lung disease as defined by an FEV1 < 40% predicted when clinically stable.Methods: 10 adults homozygous for the Phe508del received LUM/IVA. We assessed; six minute walk test (6MWT), spirometry, gas transfer (DLCO), plethysmography, and nitrogen multiple breath washout (MBW) at baseline, 4, 12, 24 and 52 weeks. Comparison was made with 10 matched historical controls that had been observed over 12 months.Results: There was a significant improvement in 6MWT by 4 weeks of treatment; with a mean increase of 78 m (SD 62.3) and this increased to 118.1 m (SD 80.9) (ANOVA p = 0.006) by 52 weeks. Significant improvements were also seen in the resting heart rate and the oxygen saturation (SaO2) after 6 min walking. A significant improvement was not seen in FEV1 though until 24 weeks, though this was maintained at 52 weeks (ANOVA, p = 0.0004). There were no significant differences seen in the MBW or DLCO. After 12 months treatment with LUM/IVA, in comparison to historical controls; the 6MWT increased by 118 m (SD 80.9), but fell in the controls - 61.3 m (SD 31.1). FEV1; LUM/IVA led to an increase of 0.398 L/min, compared to a fall in the controls - 0.18 (SD 0.2).Conclusion: In adults homozygous for Phe508del with severe disease, treatment with LUM/IVA results in a clinically significant improvement in 6MWT that was evident at 4 weeks and maintained at 52 weeks. Improvement in exercise tolerance is an important outcome to consider in those with more severe airways disease.Trial registration: This was an observational trial conducted on individuals who became eligible to receive LUM/IVA.

A Scientific Rationale for Using Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Therapeutics in COVID-19 Patients.,"Several pathological manifestations in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including thick mucus, poor mucociliary clearance, and bronchial wall thickening, overlap with cystic fibrosis disease patterns and may be indicative of ""acquired"" cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction. Indeed, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a key cytokine driving COVID-19 pathogenesis, downregulates lung CFTR protein expression, providing a strong rationale that acquired CFTR dysfunction arises in the context of COVID-19 infection. In this perspective, we propose that CFTR therapeutics, which are safe and generally well-tolerated, may provide benefit to COVID-19 patients. Although CFTR therapeutics are currently only approved for treating cystic fibrosis, there are efforts to repurpose them for conditions with ""acquired"" CFTR dysfunction, for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition to targeting the primary lung pathology, CFTR therapeutics may possess value-added effects: their anti-inflammatory properties may dampen exaggerated immune cell responses and promote cerebrovascular dilation; the latter aspect may offer some protection against COVID-19 related stroke.",33250777,PMC7672116,10.3389/fphys.2020.583862,,2020,"Lidington D, Bolz SS.",Y,MED
Is the ENaC Dysregulation in CF an Effect of Protein-Lipid Interaction in the Membranes?,"While approximately 2000 mutations have been discovered in the gene coding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), only a small amount (about 10%) is associated with clinical cystic fibrosis (CF) disease. The discovery of the association between CFTR and the hyperactive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) has raised the question of the influence of ENaC on the clinical CF phenotype. ENaC disturbance contributes to the pathological secretion, and overexpression of one ENaC subunit, the β-unit, can give a CF-like phenotype in mice with normal acting CFTR. The development of ENaC channel modulators is now in progress. Both CFTR and ENaC are located in the cell membrane and are influenced by its lipid configuration. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of the interaction of lipids and these proteins in the membranes. Linoleic acid deficiency is the most prevailing lipid abnormality in CF, and linoleic acid is an important constituent of membranes. The influence on sodium excretion by linoleic acid supplementation indicates that lipid-protein interaction is of importance for the clinical pathophysiology in CF. Further studies of this association can imply a simple clinical adjuvant in CF therapy.",33800499,PMC7962953,10.3390/ijms22052739,,2021,Strandvik B.,Y,MED
*Aspergillus*-related lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis: can imaging help us to diagnose disease?,"In people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF), viscous sputum and dysfunction of the mucociliary escalator leads to early and chronic infections. The prevalence of *Aspergillus fumigatus* in sputum is high in PwCF and the contribution of *A. fumigatus* to the progression of structural lung disease has been reported. However, overall, relatively little is known about the contribution of *A. fumigatus* to CF lung disease. More knowledge is needed to aid clinical decisions on whether to start antifungal treatment. In this review, we give an overview of *A. fumigatus* colonisation and infection in PwCF and the different types of pulmonary disease caused by it*.* Furthermore, we discuss the current evidence for structural lung damage associated with *A. fumigatus* in PwCF on chest computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.

Early Diagnosis and Intervention in Cystic Fibrosis: Imagining the Unimaginable.,"Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-shortening genetic disease affecting Caucasians, clinically manifested by fat malabsorption, poor growth and nutrition, and recurrent sinopulmonary infections. Newborn screening programs for cystic fibrosis are now implemented throughout the United States and in many nations worldwide. Early diagnosis and interventions have led to improved clinical outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. Newer cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator potentiators and correctors with mutation-specific effects have increasingly been used in children, and these agents are revolutionizing care. Indeed, it is possible that highly effective modulator therapy used early in life could profoundly affect the trajectory of cystic fibrosis lung disease, and primary prevention may be achievable.",33505947,PMC7830672,10.3389/fped.2020.608821,,2020,"Coverstone AM, Ferkol TW.",Y,MED
Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Ubiquitylation as a Novel Pharmaceutical Target for Cystic Fibrosis.,"Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR)* gene decrease the structural stability and function of the CFTR protein, resulting in cystic fibrosis. Recently, the effect of CFTR-targeting combination therapy has dramatically increased, and it is expected that add-on drugs that modulate the CFTR surrounding environment will further enhance their effectiveness. Various interacting proteins have been implicated in the structural stability of CFTR and, among them, molecules involved in CFTR ubiquitylation are promising therapeutic targets as regulators of CFTR degradation. This review focuses on the ubiquitylation mechanism that contributes to the stability of mutant CFTR at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and post-ER compartments and discusses the possibility as a pharmacological target for cystic fibrosis (CF).",32331485,PMC7243099,10.3390/ph13040075,,2020,"Fukuda R, Okiyoneda T.",Y,MED
Early Interleukin-22 and Neutrophil Proteins Are Correlated to Future Lung Damage in Children With Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) lung damage begins early in life. Lung function decline is associated with pulmonary infections, neutrophil infiltration and inflammation. In CF, neutrophils have an altered phenotype. In this pilot study, we aimed to determine if signals of dysfunctional neutrophil responses were evident early in life and whether these signals may be associated with lung damage in later childhood. We examined the pulmonary protein profiles of 14 clinical stable infants and pre-school children with CF employing the aptamer-based affinity platform, SOMAscan®. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed on all children after age 6 years and Brody score calculated. A Spearman's rank order correlation analysis and Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment was used to correlate protein concentrations in early life to Brody scores in later childhood. Early life concentrations of azurocidin and myeloperoxidase, were positively correlated with Brody score after age 6 (*p* = 0.0041 and *p* = 0.0182, respectively). Four other neutrophil associated proteins; Complement C3 (*p* = 0.0026), X-ray repair CCP 6 (*p* = 0.0059), C3a anaphylatoxin des Arginine (*p* = 0.0129) and cytokine receptor common subunit gamma (*p* = 0.0214) were all negatively correlated with Brody scores. Interestingly, patients with more severe lung damage after age 6 had significantly lower levels of IL-22 in early years of life (*p* = 0.0243). IL-22 has scarcely been reported to have implications in CF. Identification of early biomarkers that may predict more severe disease progression is particularly important for the future development of early therapeutic interventions in CF disease. We recommend further corroboration of these findings in prospective validation studies.",33869115,PMC8044422,10.3389/fped.2021.640184,,2021,"Renwick J, Reece E, Walsh J, Walsh R, Persaud T, O'Leary C, Donnelly SC, Greally P.",Y,MED
Theratyping of the Rare CFTR Variants E193K and R334W in Rectal Organoid-Derived Epithelial Monolayers.,"Background: The effect of presently available CFTR modulator combinations, such as elexacaftor (ELX), tezacaftor (TEZ), and ivacaftor (IVA), on rare CFTR alleles is often unknown. Several assays have been developed, such as forskolin-induced swelling (FIS), to evaluate the rescue of such uncommon CFTR alleles both by established and novel modulators in patient-derived primary cell cultures (organoids). Presently, we assessed the CFTR-mediated electrical current across rectal organoid-derived epithelial monolayers. This technique, which allows separate measurement of CFTR-dependent chloride or bicarbonate transport, was used to assess the effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA on two rare CFTR variants.Methods: Intestinal organoid cultures were established from rectal biopsies of CF patients carrying the rare missense mutations E193K or R334W paired with F508del. The effect of the CFTR modulator combination ELX/TEZ/IVA on CFTR-mediated Cl- and HCO3- secretion was assessed in organoid-derived intestinal epithelial monolayers. Non-CF organoids were used for comparison. Clinical biomarkers (sweat chloride, FEV1) were monitored in patients receiving modulator therapy.Results: ELX/TEZ/IVA markedly enhanced CFTR-mediated bicarbonate and chloride transport across intestinal epithelium of both patients. Consistent with the rescue of CFTR function in cultured intestinal cells, ELX/TEZ/IVA therapy improved biomarkers of CFTR function in the R334W/F508del patient.Conclusions: Current measurements in organoid-derived intestinal monolayers can readily be used to monitor CFTR-dependent epithelial Cl- and HCO3- transport. This technique can be explored to assess the functional consequences of rare CFTR mutations and the efficacy of CFTR modulators. We propose that this functional CFTR assay may guide personalized medicine in patients with CF-like clinical manifestations as well as in those carrying rare CFTR mutations.",35455747,PMC9027586,10.3390/jpm12040632,,2022,"Ciciriello F, Bijvelds MJC, Alghisi F, Meijsen KF, Cristiani L, Sorio C, Melotti P, Fiocchi AG, Lucidi V, De Jonge HR.",Y,MED
Triplet CFTR modulators: future prospects for treatment of cystic fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease characterized by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR is a chloride channel responsible for ion flow across epithelial surfaces of lung, sinuses, pancreas, intestine, and liver. Researchers have grouped CFTR genetic mutations into various protein defects: reduced protein synthesis (class 1 mutations), abnormal protein folding and maturation (class 2 mutation), and abnormal gating (class 3 mutation). These mutations usually present as severe forms of CF due to complete absence of CFTR at cell surfaces. Milder forms (eg, protein maturation and conductance defects, classes 4-6) present as less severe forms of CF related to the presence of CFTR at the cell surface. Differences in severity are directly due to CFTR function which is based on the severity of CFTR mutation. This knowledge has proven useful for designing therapy for individual mutations and mutation classes. The discovery and US Food and Drug Administration approval of Kalydeco® (ivacaftor) in early 2011 marked the beginning of a new era of therapies that are focused on improving defective CFTR protein function. However, due to its specificity for the G551D mutation, ivacaftor only benefitŝ5% of CF patients. Approximately 50% of CF patients have two copies of the F508Del mutation, while other CF patients carry only one copy of this gene. More recently, Orkambi®, a two compound medication composed of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, has provided the foundation necessary to further build on molecular concepts of: correction of trafficking, potentiation, and amplification of defective CFTR. These new concepts will form the basis of future CF therapies and extend CFTR treatment to almost 50% of CF patients. Evolving knowledge of the molecular mechanisms responsible for defective CFTR has prompted new research focused on ""repair"" of each phase of CFTR expression and function, thus creating a new class of combination ""CFTR correctors"" referred to as ""triplet CFTR compounds."" This article will review how patients can be selected and treated with these newer agents that are based on specific mutations. In the future, many CF practitioners have expectations that initiation of treatment for CF patients will occur simply by use of biomarkers of CFTR expression (eg, sweat chloride, nasal potential difference, rectal organoids) rather than testing for specific mutations. As continued research identifies biomarkers with greater specificity and which predict clinical response, therapies can potentially be tailored to individual responses.",30584312,PMC6287538,10.2147/tcrm.s147164,,2018,Chaudary N.,Y,MED

A restructuring of microbiome niche space is associated with Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor therapy in the cystic fibrosis lung.,"Background: Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor (ETI) therapy is showing promising efficacy for treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) and is becoming more widely available since recent FDA approval. However, little is known about how these drugs will affect lung infections, which are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people with CF (pwCF).Methods: We analyzed sputum microbiome and metabolome data from pwCF (n=24) before and after ETI therapy using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics.Results: The sputum microbiome diversity, particularly its evenness, was increased (p=0.036) and the microbiome profiles were different between individuals before and after therapy (PERMANOVA F=1.92, p=0.044). Despite these changes, the microbiomes remained more similar within an individual than across the sampled population. No specific microbial taxa differed in relative abundance before and after therapy, but the collective log-ratio of classic CF pathogens to anaerobes significantly decreased (p=0.013). The sputum metabolome also showed changes associated with ETI (PERMANOVA F=4.22, p=0.002) and was characterized by greater variation across subjects while on treatment. Changes in the metabolome were driven by a decrease in peptides, amino acids, and metabolites from the kynurenine pathway, which were associated with a decrease in CF pathogens. Metabolism of the three small molecules that make up ETI was extensive, including previously uncharacterized structural modifications.Conclusions: ETI therapy is associated with a changing microbiome and metabolome in airway mucus. This effect was stronger on sputum biochemistry, which may reflect changing niche space for microbial residency in lung mucus as the drug's effects take hold.Funding: This project was funded by a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Grant R01AI145925.",34824018,PMC9124239,10.1016/j.jcf.2021.11.003,,2022,"Sosinski LM, H CM, Neugebauer KA, Ghuneim LJ, Guzior DV, Castillo-Bahena A, Mielke J, Thomas R, McClelland M, Conrad D, Quinn RA.",Y,MED
Cystic Fibrosis Liver Disease: Know More.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CFTR is expressed in the apical surface of cholangiocytes. Homozygous CFTR gene mutation results in viscous and acidic bile secretions secondary to deficient surface fluid and bicarbonate efflux. Viscous, inspissated bile causes ductular obstruction and hepatotoxicity from retained bile components, leading to fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis, known as CF liver disease (CFLD). CFLD is the third leading cause of death in CF patients. CFLD manifestations can take many forms. They range from asymptomatic elevation of transaminases to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. CFLD is diagnosed after excluding other causes of chronic liver disease. To date, there is no effective therapy to prevent or treat CFLD. Management of CFLD emphasizes on optimizing nutritional status. Ursodeoxycholic acid is the only available treatment that may prevent progression of CFLD at present. All CF patients with CFLD need annual investigations and follow-up for early detection of the disease.

Impact of Physical Activity on Cognitive Functions: A New Field for Research and Management of Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease inherited by an autosomal recessive mechanism and characterized by a progressive and severe multi-organ failure. Mutations in Cystic Fibrosis Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein cause duct obstructions from dense mucus secretions and chronic inflammation related to organ damage. The progression of the disease is characterized by a decline of lung function associated with metabolic disorders and malnutrition, musculoskeletal disorders and thoracic deformities, leading to a progressive decrement of the individual's quality of life. The World Health Organization (WHO) qualifies Physical Activity (PA) as a structured activity produced by skeletal muscles' movements that requires energy consumption. In the last decade, the number of studies on PA increased considerably, including those investigating the effects of exercise on cognitive and brain health and mental performance. PA is recommended in CF management guidelines, since it improves clinic outcomes, such as peripheral neuropathy, oxygen uptake peak, bone health, glycemic control and respiratory functions. Several studies regarding the positive effects of exercise in patients with Cystic Fibrosis were carried out, but the link between the effects of exercise and cognitive and brain health in CF remains unclear. Animal models showed that exercise might improve learning and memory through structural changes of brain architecture, and such a causal relationship can also be described in humans. Indeed, both morphological and environmental factors seem to be involved in exercise-induced neural plasticity. An increase of gray matter volume in specific areas is detectable as a consequence of regular training in humans. Neurobiological processes associated with brain function improvements include biochemical modifications, such as neuromodulator or neurohormone release, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) production and synaptic activity changes. From a functional point of view, PA also seems to be an environmental factor enhancing cognitive abilities, such as executive functions, memory and processing speed. This review describes the current state of research regarding the impacts of physical activity and exercise on cognitive functions, introducing a possible novel field of research for optimizing the management of Cystic Fibrosis.",32708398,PMC7400241,10.3390/diagnostics10070489,,2020,"Elce V, Del Pizzo A, Nigro E, Frisso G, Martiniello L, Daniele A, Elce A.",Y,MED
"The cystic fibrosis treatment Trikafta affects the growth, viability, and cell wall of *Aspergillus fumigatus* biofilms.","Importance: PwCF commonly test positive for pathogenic fungi, and more than 90% of the cystic fibrosis patient population is approved for the modulator treatment, Trikafta. Therefore, it is critical to understand how fungal communities, specifically *A. fumigatus*, respond to Trikafta exposure. Therefore, we sought to determine whether Trikafta impacted the biology of *A. fumigatus* biofilms. Our data demonstrate that Trikafta reduces biomass in several laboratory strains as well as clinical strains isolated from the expectorated sputum of pwCF. Furthermore, Trikafta reduces fungal viability and the capacity of biofilms to recover following treatment. Of particular importance, Trikafta affects how *A. fumigatus* biofilms respond to cell wall stressors, suggesting that Trikafta modulates components of the cell wall. Since the cell wall directly affects how a host immune system will respond to and effectively neutralize pathogens, our work, demonstrating that Trikafta impacts the *A. fumigatus* cell wall, is potentially highly relevant to fungal-induced disease pathogenesis.",37830825,PMC10653927,10.1128/mbio.01516-23,,2023,"Jones JT, Morelli KA, Vesely EM, Puerner CTS, Pavuluri CK, Ross BS, van Rhijn N, Bromley MJ, Cramer RA.",Y,MED
Lumacaftor and Matrine: Possible Therapeutic Combination to Counteract the Inflammatory Process in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis is a monogenic, autosomal, recessive disease characterized by an alteration of chloride transport caused by mutations in the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene. The loss of Phe residue in position 508 (ΔF508-CFTR) causes an incorrect folding of the protein causing its degradation and electrolyte imbalance. CF patients are extremely predisposed to the development of a chronic inflammatory process of the bronchopulmonary system. When the cells of a tissue are damaged, the immune cells are activated and trigger the production of free radicals, provoking an inflammatory process. In addition to routine therapies, today drugs called correctors are available for mutations such as ΔF508-CFTR as well as for others less frequent ones. These active molecules are supposed to facilitate the maturation of the mutant CFTR protein, allowing it to reach the apical membrane of the epithelial cell. Matrine induces ΔF508-CFTR release from the endoplasmic reticulum to cell cytosol and its localization on the cell membrane. We now have evidence that Matrine and Lumacaftor not only restore the transport of mutant CFTR protein, but probably also counteract the inflammatory process by improving the course of the disease.",33805605,PMC7999856,10.3390/biom11030422,,2021,"Pecoraro M, Franceschelli S, Pascale M.",Y,MED
Impact of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor on depression and anxiety in cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with worsening of depression and anxiety symptoms. Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Trikafta®), a cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) modulator approved in 2019, significantly improves lung function, decreases pulmonary exacerbations, and improves quality of life. Studies are needed to evaluate the effects of Trikafta on symptoms of anxiety and depression.Research question: Do adults with CF report a change in depression and anxiety symptoms after Trikafta initiation?Study design and methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients with CF (*n* = 127) receiving care from January 2015 through February 2022. Data collected included demographics, annual PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores, FEV1 percent predicted at each visit, BMI, consistency and timeline of Trikafta use, mental health diagnoses, counseling/psychotherapy use, psychiatric medication use, prescriber of psychiatric medications, number of psychiatric emergency department visits and psychiatric hospital admissions, and sleep disturbances.Results: Of the 127 patients screened for eligibility, 100 patients were included. Data collected yielded 563 PHQ-9, 563 GAD-7, and 560 ppFEV1 data points. No significant changes in average PHQ-9 or GAD-7 scores were found after Trikafta initiation or due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, 22% of patients initiated or had a change in psychiatric medications, and patients with changes in psychiatric medications had significantly higher PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores than patients not prescribed psychiatric medications. Trikafta use improved lung function by an average of 5.23% (*p* = 8.56e-08). Around a quarter (23%) of all patients reported sleep issues after initiating Trikafta.Interpretation: No significant changes in average PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores were found after Trikafta initiation. A quarter of patients required a change in psychiatric medications, and significant differences in depression and anxiety scores were found between patients with a change in psychiatric medications and those not prescribed medication.

The NSAID glafenine rescues class 2 CFTR mutants via cyclooxygenase 2 inhibition of the arachidonic acid pathway.,"Most cases of cystic fibrosis (CF) are caused by class 2 mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). These proteins preserve some channel function but are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Partial rescue of the most common CFTR class 2 mutant, F508del-CFTR, has been achieved through the development of pharmacological chaperones (Tezacaftor and Elexacaftor) that bind CFTR directly. However, it is not clear whether these drugs will rescue all class 2 CFTR mutants to a medically relevant level. We have previously shown that the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen can correct F508del-CFTR trafficking. Here, we utilized RNAi and pharmacological inhibitors to determine the mechanism of action of the NSAID glafenine. Using cellular thermal stability assays (CETSAs), we show that it is a proteostasis modulator. Using medicinal chemistry, we identified a derivative with a fourfold increase in CFTR corrector potency. Furthermore, we show that these novel arachidonic acid pathway inhibitors can rescue difficult-to-correct class 2 mutants, such as G85E-CFTR > 13%, that of non-CF cells in well-differentiated HBE cells. Thus, the results suggest that targeting the arachidonic acid pathway may be a profitable way of developing correctors of certain previously hard-to-correct class 2 CFTR mutations.",35302062,PMC8930988,10.1038/s41598-022-08661-8,,2022,"Carlile GW, Yang Q, Matthes E, Liao J, Birault V, Sneddon HF, Poole DL, Hall CJ, Hanrahan JW, Thomas DY.",Y,MED
Impact of *Achromobacter xylosoxidans* isolation on the respiratory function of adult patients with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: The prevalence of *Achromobacter xylosoxidans* lung isolation in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients has increased, but the impact on lung function is controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of *A. xylosoxidans* isolation on respiratory function of adult patients with CF in the first 3 years after identification of *A. xylosoxidans* isolation.Methods: This was a case-control retrospective study performed at a single CF centre in Lille, France. Data for 36 patients with CF who had at least one sputum culture positive for *A. xylosoxidans* (*Ax+*) were evaluated and compared with control CF patients uninfected by *A. xylosoxidans* (*Ax-*). Respiratory function and exacerbation frequency were evaluated between 1 year prior to and 3 years after *A. xylosoxidans* isolation.Results: Compared with the *Ax*- group, the *Ax+* group had a lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) at baseline (median (interquartile range): 55.2% (50.6-59.8%) *versus* 73.8% (67.2-80.4%); p=0.005), a greater decline in FEV1 (±se) in the first year after *A. xylosoxidans* identification (-153.6±16.1 mL·year-1 *versus* -63.8±18.5 mL·year-1; p=0.0003), and more exacerbations in the first 3 years after *A. xylosoxidans* identification (9 (7-12) *versus* 7 (5-10); p=0.03). *Ax+* patients co-colonised with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (n=27, 75%) had a greater FEV1 decline (p=0.003) and more exacerbations in the year after *A. xylosoxidans* identification (p=0.037) compared with patients colonised with *A. xylosoxidans* alone. Patients with chronic *A. xylosoxidans* isolation (n=23, 64%) had more exacerbations than intermittently colonised patients in the 3 years after *A. xylosoxidans* identification (p=0.012).Conclusion: *A. xylosoxidans* isolation is associated with a decline in respiratory function in patients with CF. Chronic *A. xylosoxidans* isolation and *P. aeruginosa* co-isolation may be markers of more severe respiratory disease in *Ax*+ patients.",31832429,PMC6899338,10.1183/23120541.00051-2019,,2019,"Tetart M, Wallet F, Kyheng M, Leroy S, Perez T, Le Rouzic O, Wallaert B, Prevotat A.",Y,MED
Genetic evidence supports the development of SLC26A9 targeting therapies for the treatment of lung disease.,"Over 400 variants in the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) are CF-causing. CFTR modulators target variants to improve lung function, but marked variability in response exists and current therapies do not address all CF-causing variants highlighting unmet needs. Alternative epithelial ion channel/transporters such as SLC26A9 could compensate for CFTR dysfunction, providing therapeutic targets that may benefit all individuals with CF. We investigate the relationship between rs7512462, a marker of SLC26A9 activity, and lung function pre- and post-treatment with CFTR modulators in Canadian and US CF cohorts, in the general population, and in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Rs7512462 CC genotype is associated with greater lung function in CF individuals with minimal function variants (for which there are currently no approved therapies; p = 0.008); and for gating (p = 0.033) and p.Phe508del/ p.Phe508del (p = 0.006) genotypes upon treatment with CFTR modulators. In parallel, human nasal epithelia with CC and p.Phe508del/p.Phe508del after Ussing chamber analysis of a combination of approved and experimental modulator treatments show greater CFTR function (p = 0.0022). Beyond CF, rs7512462 is associated with peak expiratory flow in a meta-analysis of the UK Biobank and Spirometa Consortium (p = 2.74 × 10-44) and provides p = 0.0891 in an analysis of COPD case-control status in the UK Biobank defined by spirometry. These findings support SLC26A9 as a therapeutic target to improve lung function for all people with CF and in individuals with other obstructive lung diseases.",35396391,PMC8993824,10.1038/s41525-022-00299-9,,2022,"Gong J, He G, Wang C, Bartlett C, Panjwani N, Mastromatteo S, Lin F, Keenan K, Avolio J, Halevy A, Shaw M, Esmaeili M, Côté-Maurais G, Adam D, Bégin S, Bjornson C, Chilvers M, Reisman J, Price A, Parkins M, van Wylick R, Berthiaume Y, Bilodeau L, Mateos-Corral D, Hughes D, Smith MJ, Morrison N, Brusky J, Tullis E, Stephenson AL, Quon BS, Wilcox P, Leung WM, Solomon M, Sun L, Brochiero E, Moraes TJ, Gonska T, Ratjen F, Rommens JM, Strug LJ.",Y,MED

A Phase 3 Open-Label Study of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor in Children 6 through 11 Years of Age with Cystic Fibrosis and at Least One *F508del* Allele.,"**Rationale:** Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) was shown to be efficacious and safe in patients ≥12 years of age with cystic fibrosis and at least one *F508del-CFTR* (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) allele, but it has not been evaluated in children <12 years of age. **Objectives:** To assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA in children 6 through 11 years of age with *F508del*-minimal function or *F508del*-*F508del* genotypes. **Methods:** In this 24-week open-label phase 3 study, children (*N* = 66) weighing <30 kg received 50% of the ELX/TEZ/IVA adult daily dose (ELX 100 mg once daily, TEZ 50 mg once daily, and IVA 75 mg every 12 h) whereas children weighing ⩾30 kg received the full adult daily dose (ELX 200 mg once daily, TEZ 100 mg once daily, and IVA 150 mg every 12 h). **Measurements and Main Results:** The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. The safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of ELX/TEZ/IVA were generally consistent with those observed in older patients. The most commonly reported adverse events included cough, headache, and pyrexia; in most of the children who had adverse events, these were mild or moderate in severity. Through Week 24, ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment improved the percentage of predicted FEV1 (10.2 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9 to 12.6), Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised respiratory domain score (7.0 points; 95% CI, 4.7 to 9.2), lung clearance index2.5 (-1.71 units; 95% CI, -2.11 to -1.30), and sweat chloride (-60.9 mmol/L; 95% CI, -63.7 to -58.2); body mass index-for-age *z*-score increased over the 24-week treatment period when compared with the pretreatment baseline. **Conclusions:** Our results show ELX/TEZ/IVA is safe and efficacious in children 6 through 11 years of age with at least one *F508del-CFTR* allele, supporting its use in this patient population.

Spontaneous and iatrogenic hypoglycemia in cystic fibrosis.,"Spontaneous episodes of hypoglycemia can occur in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) without diabetes, who are not on glucose lowering medications. Spontaneous hypoglycemia in CF could occur both in the fasting or postprandial state (reactive hypoglycemia). The pathophysiology of fasting hypoglycemia is thought to be related to malnutrition and increased energy expenditure in the setting of inflammation and acute infections. Reactive hypoglycemia is thought to be due to impaired first phase insulin release in response to a glucose load, followed by a delayed and extended second phase insulin secretion; ineffective counterregulatory response to dropping glucose levels may also play a role. The overall prevalence of spontaneous hypoglycemia varies from 7 to 69% as examined with oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) under free living conditions. Spontaneous hypoglycemia in CF is associated with worse lung function, higher hospitalization rates, and worse clinical status. In addition, patients with CF related diabetes on glucose-lowering therapies are at risk for iatrogenic hypoglycemia. In this article, we will review the pathophysiology, prevalence, risk factors, clinical implications, and management of spontaneous and iatrogenic hypoglycemia in patients with CF.",34745906,PMC8551648,10.1016/j.jcte.2021.100267,,2021,"Hicks R, Marks BE, Oxman R, Moheet A.",Y,MED
Clinical pharmacokinetics and dose recommendations for posaconazole gastroresistant tablets in children with cystic fibrosis.,Objectives: To investigate the population pharmacokinetics of posaconazole gastroresistant tablets in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and perform simulations to recommend optimal doses.Patients and methods: Children from a paediatric CF centre who had received posaconazole tablets and underwent therapeutic drug monitoring were identified from pharmacy records. Relevant clinical data were collated from case notes and electronic patient records and used to develop an allometrically scaled population pharmacokinetic model. A stepwise covariate model-building exercise evaluated the influence of interacting medicines and liver function.Results: One hundred posaconazole serum concentrations were collected from 37 children with a median age of 14 years (range 7-17). Posaconazole pharmacokinetics were adequately described by a one-compartment model with inter-individual variability on clearance. Dose simulations demonstrated a 77%-83% probability of attaining a trough target of 1 mg/L with a dose of 300 mg every 12 h for two doses then 300 mg once daily (OD) in children aged 6-11 years; and 86%-88% with a dose of 400 mg every 12 h for two doses then 400 mg OD in adolescents aged 12-17 years. This dose scheme also yielded a 90% probability of achieving an AUC of 30 mg·h/L. AUC and trough concentration were highly correlated (r2 = 0.98). Simulations showed that trough concentrations of >0.75 mg/L would exceed an AUC of 30 mg·h/L in 90% of patients.Conclusions: A starting dose of 300 mg OD in those aged 6-11 years and 400 mg OD in those aged 12-17 years (following loading doses) yields a 90% probability of attaining an AUC of 30 mg·h/L.,34458906,PMC8598294,10.1093/jac/dkab312,,2021,"Bentley S, Davies JC, Gastine S, Donovan J, Standing JF.",Y,MED

Mepolizumab, an anti-interleukin (IL)-5 monoclonal antibody, can benefit patients with severe eosinophilic asthma and there are reports of mepolizumab use in ABPA but not in ABPA complicating CF. We present the case of an adult with CF who had recurrent ABPA and intolerable treatment side effects with steroid, azole, and omalizumab. Mepolizumab was well tolerated and led to significantly improved clinical stability and symptomatic improvement. To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful mepolizumab treatment for ABPA in CF.

Genetic Modifying Factors of Cystic Fibrosis Phenotype: A Challenge for Modern Medicine.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic autosomal recessive disease caused by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene mutations. CF is characterized by a high phenotypic variability present even in patients with the same genotype. This is due to the intervention of modifier genes that interact with both the CFTR gene and environmental factors. The purpose of this review is to highlight the role of non-CFTR genetic factors (modifier genes) that contribute to phenotypic variability in CF. We analyzed literature data starting with candidate gene studies and continuing with extensive studies, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole exome sequencing (WES). The results of both types of studies revealed that the number of modifier genes in CF patients is impressive. Their identification offers a new perspective on the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, paving the way for the understanding of other genetic disorders. In conclusion, in the future, genetic analysis, such as GWAS and WES, should be performed routinely. A challenge for future research is to integrate their results in the process of developing new classes of drugs, with a goal to improve the prognosis, increase life expectancy, and enhance quality of life among CF patients.",34945117,PMC8707808,10.3390/jcm10245821,,2021,"Butnariu LI, Țarcă E, Cojocaru E, Rusu C, Moisă ȘM, Leon Constantin MM, Gorduza EV, Trandafir LM.",Y,MED
Treatment With LAU-7b Complements CFTR Modulator Therapy by Improving Lung Physiology and Normalizing Lipid Imbalance Associated With CF Lung Disease.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive genetic disease in Caucasians, affecting more than 100,000 individuals worldwide. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the gene encoding *CFTR*, an anion channel at the plasma membrane of epithelial and other cells. Many CF pathogenic variants disrupt the biosynthesis and trafficking of CFTR or reduce its ion channel function. The most frequent mutation, loss of a phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del), leads to misfolding, retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, and premature degradation of the protein. The therapeutics available for treating CF lung disease include antibiotics, mucolytics, bronchodilators, physiotherapy, and most recently CFTR modulators. To date, no cure for this life shortening disease has been found. Treatment with the Triple combination drug therapy, TRIKAFTA®, is composed of three drugs: Elexacaftor (VX-445), Tezacaftor (VX-661) and Ivacaftor (VX-770). This therapy, benefits persons with CF, improving their weight, lung function, energy levels (as defined by reduced fatigue), and overall quality of life. We examined the effect of combining LAU-7b oral treatment and Triple therapy combination on lung function in a F508deltm1EUR mouse model that displays lung abnormalities relevant to human CF.

Healthcare resource utilization and costs among children with cystic fibrosis in the United States.,"Background: Adverse health impacts of cystic fibrosis (CF) can be present in children before respiratory complications are observed. Children with CF show progressive health decline, with increasing lung function decline in adolescence. This study aims to quantify the healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and costs attributable to CF by comparing children with CF with the general pediatric population.Methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study compared HCRU and costs among children with CF in the US with demographically similar children without CF (comparison group) over a 12-month period using administrative claims data spanning 2010-2017. Analyses were conducted by insurance type (commercially insured [COM] and Medicaid insured [MED]) and stratified by age (<2 years, 2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12-17 years).Results: Children with CF (2831 COM and 1896 MED) were matched to children in the comparison group (8493 COM and 5688 MED). Higher prevalence of comorbidities was seen in children with CF versus the comparison group across all ages. Across all ages, HCRU attributable to CF was substantial (higher hospitalization rates, more outpatient and emergency room visits, and greater use of prescription medications), and there were higher associated costs (all p values < .05), in COM and MED populations. HCRU and costs attributable to CF were highest for children aged 12-17 years.Conclusions: Substantial HCRU and costs are evident among children with CF across all ages, starting as young as infancy, with highest HCRU and costs among adolescents.

The Extrapulmonary Effects of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Modulators in Cystic Fibrosis.,"The effects of cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators on lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, and quality of life have been well documented. However, CF is a multiorgan disease, and therefore an evidence base is emerging on the systemic effects of CFTR modulators beyond the pulmonary system. This is of great clinical importance, as many of these studies provide proof of concept that CFTR modulators might be used one day to prevent or treat extrapulmonary manifestations stemming from CFTR dysfunction. In this concise review of the literature, we summarize the results of key publications that have evaluated the effects of CFTR modulators on weight and growth, pancreatic function, the gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary systems, sinus disease, bone disease, exercise tolerance, fertility, mental health, and immunity. Although many of these studies have reported beneficial extrapulmonary effects related to the use of ivacaftor (IVA) in patients with CF with at least one gating mutation, most of the evidence is low or very low quality, given the limited number of patients evaluated and the lack of control groups. Based on an even smaller number of studies evaluating the extrapulmonary effects of lumacaftor-IVA, the benefits are less clear. Although limited, these studies may provide the basis for future clinical trials to evaluate CFTR modulators on the extrapulmonary manifestations of CF.",31661636,PMC6993798,10.1513/annalsats.201909-671cme,,2020,"Sergeev V, Chou FY, Lam GY, Hamilton CM, Wilcox PG, Quon BS.",Y,MED
Congenital etiologies of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.,"Congenital exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is a rare condition. In a vast majority of patients, exocrine dysfunction occurs as part of a multisystemic disease, the most prevalent being cystic fibrosis and Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome.

"An 8 week open-label interventional multicenter study to explore the lung clearance index as endpoint for clinical trials in cystic fibrosis patients ≥8 years of age, chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","Background: Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is the only parameter currently recognized as a surrogate endpoint in cystic fibrosis (CF) trials. However, FEV1 is relatively insensitive to changes in the small airways of patients with milder lung disease. This pilot study aimed to explore the lung clearance index (LCI) as a marker for use in efficacy trials with inhaled antibiotics in CF.Methods: This open-label, single-arm study enrolled CF patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, who were treated with tobramycin (28-day on/off regime). FEV1, LCI and bacterial load in sputum (CFU) were assessed at baseline, after 1, 4 and 8 weeks of treatment.Results: All patients (n = 17) showed elevated LCI of > 11 despite 3 patients having normal FEV1 (> 90% predicted) at baseline. Overall, LCI improved in 8 (47%) patients and FEV1 in 9 (53%) patients. At week 4, LCI improved by 0.88, FEV1 increased by 0.52%, and P. aeruginosa reduced by 30,481.3 CFU/mL. These changes were however statistically non-significant. Six adverse events occurred in 5/17 (29.4%) patients, most of which were mild-to-moderate in severity.Conclusions: Due to the low evaluable sample size, no specific trend was observed related to the changes between LCI, FEV1 and CFU. Based on the individual data from this study and from recently published literature, LCI has been shown to be a more sensitive parameter than FEV1 for lung function. LCI can be hypothesized to be an appropriate endpoint for efficacy trials in CF patients if the heterogeneity in lung function is limited by enrolling younger patients or patients with more milder lung disease and thus, limiting the ventilation inhomogeneities.Trial registration: The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT02248922.",32532226,PMC7291662,10.1186/s12890-020-01201-y,,2020,"Sutharsan S, Naehrig S, Mellies U, Sieder C, Ziegler J.",Y,MED
Profile of tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination and its potential in the treatment of cystic fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting autosomal recessive disease caused by dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel. Management of CF has traditionally relied upon managing complications of CFTR protein dysfunction and this has led to a steady improvement in survival of CF patients. However, the landscape of CF care has changed substantially over the last decade with the discovery of CFTR modulators that aim to increase or potentially restore the function of the disease-causing CFTR protein. This narrative review summarizes the development of CFTR therapies so far with emphasis on tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination therapy. We have also summarized the Phase II results of triple combination therapy which promises an effective CFTR modulator therapy for more than 90% of CF patients.",31692517,PMC6710479,10.2147/tcrm.s165027,,2019,"Shiferaw D, Faruqi S.",Y,MED
"Target Identification with Live-Cell Photoaffinity Labeling and Mechanism of Action Elucidation of ARN23765, a Highly Potent CFTR Corrector.","Molecular-targeted therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) rely on small-molecule modulators that rescue the activity of the defective CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel. **ARN23765** is a small molecule with subnanomolar potency in rescuing the function of mutant CFTR in bronchial epithelial cells from CF patients carrying the F508del-CFTR mutation. Considering the multifaceted interactions of CFTR with the plasma membrane and the complexity of the protein network within the cellular compartments, here we report the investigation of **ARN23765**'s molecular mechanism in live cells. We used the photoaffinity labeling (PAL) approach to demonstrate the interaction of **ARN23765**-derived probes with CFTR in cells. We showed that **ARN23765** contributes to F508del-CFTR rescue by stabilizing the membrane-spanning domain-1 and interacting with CFTR at the same site as other type I CFTR correctors. Our study characterizes **ARN23765**'s mode of action and highlights the potential of studying the interactions between CFTR and its correctors in live cells.",39928576,PMC11873939,10.1021/acs.jmedchem.4c02654,,2025,"Romeo E, Saccoliti F, Ocello R, Andonaia A, Allegretta C, Pastorino C, Pedemonte N, Falchi F, Laselva O, Bandiera T, Bertozzi F.",Y,MED
Safety and efficacy of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator potentiator icenticaftor (QBW251).,"Background: This is the first-in-human study of icenticaftor, an oral potentiator of the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel. Restoration of CFTR activity has shown significant clinical benefits, but more studies are needed to address all CFTR mutations.Methods: Safety, pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics of icenticaftor were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers. Efficacy was assessed in adult CF patients with ≥1 pre-specified CFTR Class III or IV mutation (150 and 450 mg bid), or homozygous for F508del mutation (450 mg bid). Primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in lung clearance index (LCI2.5). Secondary endpoints included %predicted FEV1 and sweat chloride level.Results: Class IV mutations were present in 22 patients, Class III in 2 (both S549N), and 25 were homozygous for F508del. Icenticaftor was well-tolerated in healthy and CF subjects with no unexpected events or discontinuations in the CF groups. The most frequent study-drug related adverse events in CF patients were nausea (12.2%), headache (10.2%), and fatigue (6.1%). Icenticaftor 450 mg bid for 14 days showed significant improvements in all endpoints versus placebo in patients with Class III and IV mutations; mean %predicted FEV1 increased by 6.46%, LCI2.5 decreased by 1.13 points and sweat chloride decreased by 8.36 mmol/L. No significant efficacy was observed in patients homozygous for a single F508del.Conclusions: Icenticaftor was safe and well-tolerated in healthy volunteers and CF patients, and demonstrated clinically meaningful changes in lung function and sweat chloride level in CF patients with Class III and IV CFTR mutations.

Cystic fibrosis rabbits develop spontaneous hepatobiliary lesions and CF-associated liver disease (CFLD)-like phenotypes.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease affecting multiple organs. Approximately 30% CF patients develop CF-related liver disease (CFLD), which is the third most common cause of morbidity and mortality of CF. CFLD is progressive, and many of the severe forms eventually need liver transplantation. The mechanistic studies and therapeutic interventions to CFLD are unfortunately very limited. Utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we recently generated CF rabbits by introducing mutations to the rabbit CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Here we report the liver phenotypes and mechanistic insights into the liver pathogenesis in these animals. CF rabbits develop spontaneous hepatobiliary lesions and abnormal biliary secretion accompanied with altered bile acid profiles. They exhibit nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-like phenotypes, characterized by hepatic inflammation, steatosis, and fibrosis, as well as altered lipid profiles and diminished glycogen storage. Mechanistically, our data reveal that multiple stress-induced metabolic regulators involved in hepatic lipid homeostasis were up-regulated in the livers of CF-rabbits, and that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response mediated through IRE1α-XBP1 axis as well as NF-κB- and JNK-mediated inflammatory responses prevail in CF rabbit livers. These findings show that CF rabbits manifest many CFLD-like phenotypes and suggest targeting hepatic ER stress and inflammatory pathways for potential CFLD treatment.",36712930,PMC9832953,10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac306,,2023,"Wu Q, Liang X, Hou X, Song Z, Bouhamdan M, Qiu Y, Koike Y, Rajagopalan C, Wei HG, Jiang H, Hish G, Zhang J, Chen YE, Jin JP, Xu J, Zhang K, Sun F.",Y,MED

Elexacaftor is a CFTR potentiator and acts synergistically with ivacaftor during acute and chronic treatment.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which lead to early death due to progressive lung disease. The development of small-molecule modulators that directly interact with CFTR to aid in protein folding (""correctors"") and/or increase channel function (""potentiators"") have proven to be highly effective in the therapeutic treatment of CF. Notably, incorporation of the next-generation CFTR corrector, elexacaftor, into a triple combination therapeutic (marketed as Trikafta) has shown tremendous clinical promise in treating CF caused by F508del-CFTR. Here, we report on a newly-described role of elexacaftor as a CFTR potentiator. We explore the acute and chronic actions, pharmacology, and efficacy of elexacaftor as a CFTR potentiator in restoring function to multiple classes of CFTR mutations. We demonstrate that the potentiating action of elexacaftor exhibits multiplicative synergy with the established CFTR potentiator ivacaftor in rescuing multiple CFTR class defects, indicating that a new combination therapeutic of ivacaftor and elexacaftor could have broad impact on CF therapies.",34615919,PMC8494914,10.1038/s41598-021-99184-1,,2021,"Shaughnessy CA, Zeitlin PL, Bratcher PE.",Y,MED
Treatment of cystic fibrosis related bone disease.,"The advent of highly effective CFTR modulator therapies has slowed the progression of pulmonary complications in people with cystic fibrosis. There is increased interest in cystic fibrosis bone disease (CFBD) due to the increasing longevity of people with cystic fibrosis. CFBD is a complex and multifactorial disease. CFBD is a result of hypomineralized bone leading to poor strength, structure and quality leading to susceptibility to fractures. The development of CFBD spans different age groups. The management must be tailored to each group with nuance and based on available guidelines while balancing therapeutic benefits to risks of long-term use of bone-active medication. For now, the mainstay of treatment includes bisphosphonates. However, the long-term effects of bisphosphonate treatment in people with CF are not fully understood. We describe newer agents available for osteoporosis treatment. Still, the lack of data behooves trials of monoclonal antibodies treatments such as Denosumab and Romozosumab and anabolic bone therapy such as teriparatide and Abaloparatide. In this review, we also summarize screening and non-pharmacologic treatment of CFBD and describe the various options available for the pharmacotherapy of CFBD. We address the prospect of CFTR modulators on bone health while awaiting long-term trials to describe the effects of these medications on bone health.",35059303,PMC8760456,10.1016/j.jcte.2021.100291,,2022,"Ullal J, Kutney K, Williams KM, Weber DR.",Y,MED
From Ivacaftor to Triple Combination: A Systematic Review of Efficacy and Safety of CFTR Modulators in People with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Over the last years *CFTR* (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) modulators have shown the ability to improve relevant clinical outcomes in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). This review aims at a systematic research of the current evidence on efficacy and tolerability of *CFTR* modulators for different genetic subsets of patients with CF. Two investigators independently performed the search on PubMed and included phase 2 and 3 clinical trials published in the study period 1 January 2005-31 January 2020. A final pool of 23 papers was included in the systematic review for a total of 4219 patients. For each paper data of interest were extracted and reported in table. In terms of lung function, patients who had the most beneficial effects from *CFTR* modulation were those patients with one gating mutation receiving IVA (ivacaftor) and patients with p.Phe508del mutation, both homozygous and heterozygous, receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) had the most relevant beneficial effects in term of lung function, pulmonary exacerbation decrease, and symptom improvement. *CFTR* modulators showed an overall favorable safety profile.

The Distribution and Role of the CFTR Protein in the Intracellular Compartments.,"Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease that mainly affects secretory organs in humans. It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding CFTR with the most common phenylalanine deletion at position 508. CFTR is an anion channel mainly conducting Cl- across the apical membranes of many different epithelial cells, the impairment of which causes dysregulation of epithelial fluid secretion and thickening of the mucus. This, in turn, leads to the dysfunction of organs such as the lungs, pancreas, kidney and liver. The CFTR protein is mainly localized in the plasma membrane; however, there is a growing body of evidence that it is also present in the intracellular organelles such as the endosomes, lysosomes, phagosomes and mitochondria. Dysfunction of the CFTR protein affects not only the ion transport across the epithelial tissues, but also has an impact on the proper functioning of the intracellular compartments. The review aims to provide a summary of the present state of knowledge regarding CFTR localization and function in intracellular compartments, the physiological role of this localization and the consequences of protein dysfunction at cellular, epithelial and organ levels. An in-depth understanding of intracellular processes involved in CFTR impairment may reveal novel opportunities in pharmacological agents of cystic fibrosis.",34832033,PMC8618639,10.3390/membranes11110804,,2021,"Lukasiak A, Zajac M.",Y,MED
Signature and Molecular Mechanism of Mitochondrial Energy Metabolism Pathway-Related Genes in Lung Adenocarcinoma.,"Objective: The mitochondrial energy metabolic pathway (MEMP) is the primary energy metabolism of tumor cells, and its disruption may promote cancer emergence, spreading, and immune escape. However, there is a lack of studies to determine the relationship between relevant functional mechanisms and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) prognosis.Methods: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was employed to determine MEMP pathway-related genes. Then, a prognostic model was created using the MEMP key genes that were found by LASSO-Cox regression analysis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases provided the training and validation sets. Furthermore, the infiltration of immune cells was examined by ssGSEA. Finally, a screening of candidate therapeutic compounds for LUAD patients was performed using DrugBank, Protein Data Bank (PDB), and AutoDock Vina databases.Results: First, 266 MEMP pathway-related genes that exhibited aberrant activity in tumors were identified. Then, 19 MEMP key genes were used to build a prognostic model, which can successfully predict the survival rates of LUAD patients after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that patients in the high-risk group had considerably lower survival outcomes than those in the low-risk group. Furthermore, it was discovered that the high-risk group had the majority of activated T cells, while the low-risk group tended to have more other activated immune cells. The majority of immunological checkpoints expressed themselves more strongly in the high-risk group as well. Finally, 11 prospective medication small molecules were obtained from the projected potential therapeutic drugs, with DB0980 being regarded as the most promising of them for the treatment of LUAD.Conclusion: This current study developed reliable prognostic signature, called MEMP score, which provides new guidance for prognostic assessment, immunotherapy, and drug development in LUAD. Thereby, DB0980 appears to be the most likely approach for the treatment of LUAD.",36046378,PMC9423994,10.1155/2022/3201600,,2022,"Liu J, Zhang F, Zhong J, Zheng Z.",Y,MED
Preclinical evaluation of the epithelial sodium channel inhibitor BI 1265162 for treatment of cystic fibrosis.,"Background: Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is an important regulator of airway surface liquid volume; ENaC is hyperactivated in cystic fibrosis (CF). ENaC inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CF. Here, we report *in vitro* and *in vivo* results for BI 1265162, an inhaled ENaC inhibitor currently in Phase II clinical development, administered *via* the Respimat® Soft Mist™ inhaler.Methods: *In vitro* inhibition of sodium ion (Na+) transport by BI 1265162 was tested in mouse renal collecting duct cells (M1) and human bronchial epithelial cells (NCI-H441); inhibition of water transport was measured using M1 cells. *In vivo* inhibition of liquid absorption from rat airway epithelium and acceleration of mucociliary clearance (MCC) in sheep lungs were assessed. Fully differentiated normal and CF human epithelium was used to measure the effect of BI 1265162 with or without ivacaftor and lumacaftor on water transport and MCC.Results: BI 1265162 dose-dependently inhibited Na+ transport and decreased water resorption in cell line models. BI 1265162 reduced liquid absorption in rat lungs and increased MCC in sheep. No effects on renal function were seen in the animal models. BI 1265162 alone and in combination with CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators decreased water transport and increased MCC in both normal and CF airway human epithelial models and also increased the effects of CFTR modulators in CF epithelium to reach the effect size seen in healthy epithelium with ivacaftor/lumacaftor alone.Conclusion: These results demonstrate the potential of BI 1265162 as a mutation agnostic, ENaC-inhibitor-based therapy for CF.",33313305,PMC7720687,10.1183/23120541.00429-2020,,2020,"Nickolaus P, Jung B, Sabater J, Constant S, Gupta A.",Y,MED
Research advances in molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis: From technical improvement to clinical applications (Review).,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic disease causing severe impairment to the respiratory system and digestive tracts. Currently, CF is incurable. As an autosomal recessive disorder, the morbidity of CF is significantly higher among Caucasians of European descent, whereas it is less pervasive among African and Asian populations. The disease is caused by identical mutations (homozygosity) or different mutations (heterozygosity) of an autosomal recessive mutation at position 7q31.2‑q31.1 of chromosome 7. Diagnostic criteria and guidelines work concurrently with laboratory detection to facilitate precise CF detection. With technological advances, the understanding of CF pathogenesis has reached an unprecedented level, allowing for increasingly precise carrier screening, more effective early stage CF intervention and improved prognostic outcomes. These advances significantly increase the life quality and expectancy of patients with CF. Given the numerous improvements in the field of CF, the current review summarized the technical advances in the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying CF, as well as how these improvements facilitate the clinical outcomes of CF. Furthermore, challenges and obstacles to overcome are discussed.",33173976,PMC7646950,10.3892/mmr.2020.11607,,2020,"Wei T, Sui H, Su Y, Cheng W, Liu Y, He Z, Ji Q, Xu C.",Y,MED
Sustained Glycemic Control With Ivacaftor in Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes.,"Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is a common comorbidity in cystic fibrosis with pancreatic insufficiency occurring early in the disease process.

Understanding the Pancreatic Islet Microenvironment in Cystic Fibrosis and the Extrinsic Pathways Leading to Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive chronic condition effecting approximately 70 000 to 100 000 people globally and is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator. Through improvements in clinical care, life expectancy in CF has increased considerably associated with rising incidence of secondary complications including CF-related diabetes (CFRD). CFRD is believed to result from β-cell loss as well as insufficient insulin secretion due to β-cell dysfunction, but the underlying pathophysiology is not yet fully understood. Here we review the morphological and cellular changes in addition to the architectural remodelling of the pancreatic exocrine and endocrine compartments in CF and CFRD pancreas. We consider also potential underlying proinflammatory signalling pathways impacting on endocrine and specifically β-cell function, concluding that further research focused on these mechanisms may uncover novel therapeutic targets enabling restoration of normal insulin secretion.",34675737,PMC8524685,10.1177/11795514211048813,,2021,"Al-Selwi Y, Shaw JA, Kattner N.",Y,MED
COVID-19 pandemic restrictions continuously impact on physical activity in adults with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: We have recently reported reduced physical activity (PA) in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) with and without lung transplantation (LTX) during a 6-week stringent lockdown in Switzerland. This follow-up study explores the impact of coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) related pandemic restrictions on individuals' therapy regimens and health-related aspects in pwCF.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional web-based national survey in Spring 2021. The survey included questions on daily PA, airway clearance and inhalation therapy, questions on COVID-19-compatible symptoms, diagnostic tests and vaccination status, and enquired health-related aspects covering the pandemic period between March 2020 to April 2021.Results: 193 individuals with CF (53% female; 25% LTX recipients) participated. Among pwCF, 10 reported COVID-19 (n = 2 LTX recipients), two subjects were hospitalized, no invasive ventilation required, no deaths. The clinical course was generally mild. Overall, 46% reported less PA during the pandemic, mostly due to closed fitness facilities (85%), lack of motivation (34%), and changes in daily structures (21%). In contrast, 32/193 (17%) pwCF were able to increase their PA levels: 12 (38%) and 11 (34%) reported undertaking home-based training and outdoor activities more frequently; 6 (19%) reported an increase in routine PA, and another 3 (9%) started new activities. Among pwCF without LTX, 5% and 4% reported to undertake less airway clearance and inhalation therapy, respectively.Conclusions: Our study reveals unfavorable consequences of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on PA of pwCF with unknown long-term consequences for their overall physical fitness and lung health. Strategies to overcome this undesirable situation are needed; increased uptake of telehealth PA programs and virtual exercise classes to promote PA participation might be one promising approach along with vaccination of pwCF and their close contacts.",34555108,PMC8460042,10.1371/journal.pone.0257852,,2021,"Radtke T, Haile SR, Dressel H, Benden C.",Y,MED

SUN-LB026 Do CFTR Modulators Treat Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes?,"Abstract Background: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators are a recent advancement in the treatment of cystic fibrosis and were initially approved for their beneficial effect on lung function. There have also been few reports of their positive role in glycemic control in patients with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes related to cystic fibrosis. Clinical Case: Ms. A is a 27yr old female who presented to our Endocrinology Clinic for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). She was diagnosed with diabetes in 2015. By August 2017 her diabetes had deteriorated and she presented to the hospital with severe hyperglycemia. She had blood glucose levels over 400 mg/dL and HbA1c of 10.8% without diabetic ketoacidosis. Physical exam at that time was unremarkable. Her BMI was 21.5 kg/m2. She then started a multiple daily injection program that included Glargine and prandial Aspart insulins. Four months later her hemoglobin A1c improved to 7.9%. Past medical history was significant for cystic fibrosis with homozygous F508 deletion. Her cystic fibrosis had been complicated by bronchiectasis, recurrent sinusitis, pneumonia, pancreatic insufficiency and staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with sepsis. Earlier in 2018, the patient was started on treatment with Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and then Symdeko (tezacaftor/ivacaftor). Interestingly, subsequently Ms. A noticed an improvement of her blood glucose levels and also started having episodes of hypoglycemia. After about 10 months of use of CFTR modulators, she stopped using Glargine as well as prandial Aspart insulins and just required a couple of units of Aspart occasionally when her blood glucose levels were above target. That happened sporadically. On her last follow up in Dec 2018, Ms. A was feeling well and denied symptoms of hyperglycemia. Her HbA1c at that time was 7.0%, despite the fact that she was not taking long-acting insulin or scheduled prandial insulin for a couple months. Conclusion: CFRD is a distinct form of diabetes mellitus sharing features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In the recent years, CFTR modulators got approved for the treatment of CF showing improvement in lung function. There is limited evidence that suggests that treatment with CFTR modulators may have a beneficial effect on glycemic control in patients with CFRD with one case report showing resolution of CFRD1. Our case supports this hypothesis. The long-term effect of these medications on progression of CFRD and associated complications is still unknown. Further studies are needed to clarify these questions. References: 1. Standards S, Organisation M. References 1. 2014;28(2013):438-453. doi:10.1016/j.pedn.2008.

Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes (CFRD): Overview of Associated Genetic Factors.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disease in the Caucasian population and is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene that encodes for a chloride/bicarbonate channel expressed on the membrane of epithelial cells of the airways and of the intestine, as well as in cells with exocrine and endocrine functions. A common nonpulmonary complication of CF is cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD), a distinct form of diabetes due to insulin insufficiency or malfunction secondary to destruction/derangement of pancreatic betacells, as well as to other factors that affect their function. The prevalence of CFRD increases with age, and 40-50% of CF adults develop the disease. Several proposed hypotheses on how CFRD develops have emerged, including exocrine-driven fibrosis and destruction of the entire pancreas, as well as contrasting theories on the direct or indirect impact of *CFTR* mutation on islet function.

Systems Biology and Bile Acid Signalling in Microbiome-Host Interactions in the Cystic Fibrosis Lung.,"The study of the respiratory microbiota has revealed that the lungs of healthy and diseased individuals harbour distinct microbial communities. Imbalances in these communities can contribute to the pathogenesis of lung disease. How these imbalances occur and establish is largely unknown. This review is focused on the genetically inherited condition of Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Understanding the microbial and host-related factors that govern the establishment of chronic CF lung inflammation and pathogen colonisation is essential. Specifically, dissecting the interplay in the inflammation-pathogen-host axis. Bile acids are important host derived and microbially modified signal molecules that have been detected in CF lungs. These bile acids are associated with inflammation and restructuring of the lung microbiota linked to chronicity. This community remodelling involves a switch in the lung microbiota from a high biodiversity/low pathogen state to a low biodiversity/pathogen-dominated state. Bile acids are particularly associated with the dominance of Proteobacterial pathogens. The ability of bile acids to impact directly on both the lung microbiota and the host response offers a unifying principle underpinning the pathogenesis of CF. The modulating role of bile acids in lung microbiota dysbiosis and inflammation could offer new potential targets for designing innovative therapeutic approaches for respiratory disease.",34202495,PMC8300688,10.3390/antibiotics10070766,,2021,"Woods DF, Flynn S, Caparrós-Martín JA, Stick SM, Reen FJ, O'Gara F.",Y,MED
Pharmacotherapeutic Patterns and Patients' Access to Pharmacotherapy for Some Rare Diseases in Bulgaria - A Pilot Comparative Study.,"Provision of the latest innovative and advanced therapies for rare diseases (RDs) patients, following the international therapeutic recommendations, is crucial and necessary for both practitioners and patients. The goal is to assess the access of Bulgarian patients with the most cost-consuming RDs to medicines and to compare the pharmacotherapeutic patterns in Bulgaria and the relevant European professional associations. Pharmaco-therapeutic guidelines for treating the most cost-consuming RDs in Bulgaria were analyzed to assess their compliance with the European ones. Market entrance was evaluated through analysis of the availability of medicines in the Positive Drug List (PDL) and their date of inclusion since marketing authorization. Guidelines' compliance index was calculated and patient access was analyzed through evaluation of the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) standards, which provide additional criteria for treatment initiation. The analyzed guidelines follow the adopted recommendations by the relevant European professional associations. NHIF have exclusion and inclusion criteria for initiating treatment with medicines for rare diseases and for continuation. The average time-lag between centralized procedure approval and inclusion in the Bulgarian PDL for orphan medicinal products (MPs) is 6.75 years (SD = 4.96) with the longest time observed for eptacog alfa (20 years) and the shortest for rurioctocog alfa pegol, octocog alfa and simoctocog alfa (1 year). Bulgarian patients with cystic fibrosis with pulmonary manifestation had a wait time of only 1.6 years to get access to innovative, centrally authorized medicines, whereas the period for access to acromegaly treatment was 8.2 years. The main factors influencing market entrance and patient access are the time to inclusion in the PDL and the NHIF criteria.",34349654,PMC8326790,10.3389/fphar.2021.695181,,2021,"Kamusheva M, Dimitrova M, Tachkov K, Petrova G, Mitkova Z.",Y,MED
Auxological and Endocrinological Features in Children and Adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations that lead to deficient or dysfunctional CF transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) proteins. Patients typically present malnutrition resulting from the malabsorption of fundamental nutrients and recurring lung infections, with a progressive worsening of the respiratory function. For these reasons, the clinical management of CF requires a multidisciplinary team. From an endocrinological point of view, patients often present major complications, such as diabetes, bone disease, thyroid disorders, delayed growth and puberty, hypogonadism and infertility, which negatively affect their quality of life and, in some cases, significantly reduce life expectancy. These complications can arise as a direct result of *CFTR* dysfunction and/or as a consequence of a deterioration in the function of the organs affected. The objective of this review is to analyze all the possible endocrinological complications that can occur in patients with CF by evaluating the most recent papers in the literature.",35887806,PMC9323690,10.3390/jcm11144041,,2022,"Ferrari V, Terlizzi V, Stagi S.",Y,MED

Dysregulated signalling pathways in innate immune cells with cystic fibrosis mutations.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common life-limiting recessive genetic disorders in Caucasians, caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CF is a multi-organ disease that involves the lungs, pancreas, sweat glands, digestive and reproductive systems and several other tissues. This debilitating condition is associated with recurrent lower respiratory tract bacterial and viral infections, as well as inflammatory complications that may eventually lead to pulmonary failure. Immune cells play a crucial role in protecting the organs against opportunistic infections and also in the regulation of tissue homeostasis. Innate immune cells are generally affected by CFTR mutations in patients with CF, leading to dysregulation of several cellular signalling pathways that are in continuous use by these cells to elicit a proper immune response. There is substantial evidence to show that airway epithelial cells, neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages all contribute to the pathogenesis of CF, underlying the importance of the CFTR in innate immune responses. The goal of this review is to put into context the important role of the CFTR in different innate immune cells and how CFTR dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of CF, highlighting several signalling pathways that may be dysregulated in cells with CFTR mutations.",32367193,PMC7599191,10.1007/s00018-020-03540-9,,2020,"Lara-Reyna S, Holbrook J, Jarosz-Griffiths HH, Peckham D, McDermott MF.",Y,MED
Esc peptides as novel potentiators of defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator: an unprecedented property of antimicrobial peptides.,"Mutations in the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein lead to persistent lung bacterial infections, mainly due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, causing loss of respiratory function and finally death of people affected by CF. Unfortunately, even in the era of CFTR modulation therapies, management of pulmonary infections in CF remains highly challenging especially for patients with advanced stages of lung disease. Recently, we identified antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), namely Esc peptides, with potent antipseudomonal activity. In this study, by means of electrophysiological techniques and computational studies we discovered their ability to increase the CFTR-controlled ion currents, by direct interaction with the F508del-CFTR mutant. Remarkably, this property was not explored previously with any AMPs or peptides in general. More interestingly, in contrast with clinically used CFTR modulators, Esc peptides would give particular benefit to CF patients by combining their capability to eradicate lung infections and to act as promoters of airway wound repair with their ability to ameliorate the activity of the channel with conductance defects. Overall, our findings not only highlighted Esc peptides as the first characterized AMPs with a novel property, that is the potentiator activity of CFTR, but also paved the avenue to investigate the functions of AMPs and/or other peptide molecules, for a new up-and-coming pharmacological approach to address CF lung disease.",34971429,PMC8752549,10.1007/s00018-021-04030-2,,2021,"Ferrera L, Cappiello F, Loffredo MR, Puglisi E, Casciaro B, Botta B, Galietta LJV, Mori M, Mangoni ML.",Y,MED
Genetic spectrum of Chinese children with cystic fibrosis: comprehensive data analysis from the main referral centre in China.,"Background and objectives: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a heterogeneous disease with a diverse genetic spectrum among populations. Few patients with CF of Chinese origin have been reported worldwide. The objective of this study is to characterise the genotypic features of CF in Chinese children.Methods: We recruited and characterised the genetic manifestations of 103 Chinese children with CF in Beijing Children's Hospital from 2010 to 2022. Whole-exome sequencing were performed to define the genotypes. Meanwhile, other 99 genetically confirmed patients with Chinese origin described in 45 references were also summarised.Results: 158 different variants including 23 novel observations were identified after sequencing. The majority of *CFTR* variants (82.3%) in Chinese have been observed only once or twice. 43.7% of the variants were only identified in patients of Chinese origin. The c.2909G>A(p.Gly970Asp), c.1766+5G>T and c.1657C>T(p.Arg553X) were the most frequent variants among Chinese patients, with allele frequency of 12.1%, 5.4% and 3.6%, respectively. The first two variants both showed significant Chinese ethnic tendency, while the latter one most likely came from Europeans for historical reasons. They also demonstrated significant differences in geographical distribution. c.1521_1523delCTT(p.F508del) was rarely observed in patients of pure Chinese origin, with an allele frequency of 1.8%. Two de novo variants (c.960dupA[p.Ser321IlefsX43] and c.2491-2A>G) and two deep-intronic variants (c.3718-2477C>T and c.3874-4522A>G) were identified, which were also quite rare among Chinese.Conclusions: The genetic spectrum of CF in Chinese is unique and quite different from that observed in Caucasians. The geographical distributions of the most frequent variants were reported for the first time.",35858753,PMC9985745,10.1136/jmg-2022-108501,,2022,"Shen Y, Tang X, Chen Q, Xu H, Liu H, Liu J, Yang H, Li H, Zhao S.",Y,MED
Lipid-driven CFTR clustering is impaired in cystic fibrosis and restored by corrector drugs.,"Membrane proteins often cluster in nanoscale membrane domains (lipid rafts) that coalesce into ceramide-rich platforms during cell stress, however the clustering mechanisms remain uncertain. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF), forms clusters that are cholesterol dependent and become incorporated into long-lived platforms during hormonal stimulation. We report here that clustering does not involve known tethering interactions of CFTR with PDZ domain proteins, filamin A or the actin cytoskeleton. It also does not require CFTR palmitoylation but is critically dependent on membrane lipid order and is induced by detergents that increase the phase separation of membrane lipids. Clustering and integration of CFTR into ceramide-rich platforms are abolished by the disease mutations F508del and S13F and rescued by the CFTR modulators elexacaftor plus tezacaftor. These results indicate CF therapeutics that correct mutant protein folding restore both trafficking and normal lipid interactions in the plasma membrane.

Sharing Patient-Controlled Real-World Data Through the Application of the Theory of Commons: Action Research Case Study.,"Background: Technological advances have radically changed the opportunities for individuals with chronic conditions to practice self-care and to coproduce health care and research. Digital technologies enable patients to perform tasks traditionally carried out by health care professionals in a more convenient way, at lower costs, and without compromising quality. Patients may also share real-world data with other stakeholders to promote individual and population health. However, there is a need for legal frameworks that enable patient privacy and control in such sharing of real-world data. We believe that this need could be met by the conceptualization of patient-controlled real-world data as knowledge commons, which is a resource shared by a group of people.Objective: This study aimed to propose a conceptual model that describes how patient-controlled real-world data can be shared effectively in chronic care management, in a way that supports individual and population health, while respecting personal data privacy and control.Methods: An action research approach was used to develop a solution to enable patients, in a self-determined way, to share patient-controlled data to other settings. We chose the context of cystic fibrosis (CF) care in Sweden, where coproduction between patients, their families, and health care professionals is critical in the introduction of new drugs. The first author, who is a lawyer and parent of children with CF, was a driver in the change process. All coauthors collaborated in the analysis. We collected primary and secondary data reflecting changes during the time period from 2012 to 2020, and performed a qualitative content analysis guided by the knowledge commons framework.Results: Through a series of changes, a national system for enabling patients to share patient-controlled real-world data to different stakeholders in CF care was implemented. The case analysis resulted in a conceptual model consisting of the following three knowledge commons arenas that contributed to patient-controlled real-world data collection, use, and sharing: (1) patient world arena involving the private sphere of patients and families; (2) clinical microsystem arena involving the professional sphere at frontline health care clinics; and (3) round table arena involving multiple stakeholders from different settings. Based on the specification of property rights, as presented in our model, the patient can keep control over personal health information and may grant use rights to other stakeholders.Conclusions: Health information exchanges for sharing patient-controlled real-world data are pivotal to enable patients, health care professionals, health care funders, researchers, authorities, and the industry to coproduce high-quality care and to introduce and follow-up novel health technologies. Our model proposes how technical and legal structures that protect the integrity and self-determination of patients can be implemented, which may be applicable in other chronic care settings as well.",33464212,PMC7854041,10.2196/16842,,2021,"Hager A, Lindblad S, Brommels M, Salomonsson S, Wannheden C.",Y,MED

"One Size Does Not Fit All: The Past, Present and Future of Cystic Fibrosis Causal Therapies.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common monogenic disorder, caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene. Over the last 30 years, tremendous progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of CF and the development of treatments that target the underlying defects in CF. Currently, a highly effective CFTR modulator treatment (Kalydeco™/Trikafta™) is available for 90% of people with CF. In this review, we will give an extensive overview of past and ongoing efforts in the development of therapies targeting the molecular defects in CF. We will discuss strategies targeting the CFTR protein (i.e., CFTR modulators such as correctors and potentiators), its cellular environment (i.e., proteostasis modulation, stabilization at the plasma membrane), the *CFTR* mRNA (i.e., amplifiers, nonsense mediated mRNA decay suppressors, translational readthrough inducing drugs) or the *CFTR* gene (gene therapies). Finally, we will focus on how these efforts can be applied to the 15% of people with CF for whom no causal therapy is available yet.",35740997,PMC9220995,10.3390/cells11121868,,2022,"Ensinck MM, Carlon MS.",Y,MED
A Systematic Review of the Clinical Efficacy and Safety of CFTR Modulators in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Several placebo-controlled trials have been recently published evaluating novel therapies targeting the defective CFTR protein. This systematic review examines the clinical efficacy and safety of CFTR modulators in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) with specific genetic mutations. Online sources were searched for placebo-controlled, parallel-design clinical trials investigating CFTR modulators from January 1, 2005 to March 31, 2018. The primary outcome of interest was FEV1% predicted (ppFEV1). Fourteen RCTs met our eligibility criteria. The largest improvement in ppFEV1 favouring treatment was observed for ivacaftor (IVA) in G551D individuals (≥6 years old). Both tezacaftor-ivacaftor (TEZ-IVA) and lumacaftor-ivacaftor (LUM-IVA) also improved ppFEV1 in F508del homozygous individuals but there was increased reporting of respiratory adverse events with LUM-IVA compared to placebo. IVA also significantly improved ppFEV1 in a sub-group of individuals ≥18 years old with an R117H mutation. No significant improvements in ppFEV1 were observed for IVA, LUM, or TEZ in F508del homozygous individuals, LUM or LUM-IVA in F508del heterozygous individuals, or ataluren in individuals with a nonsense mutation. Significant improvements in ppFEV1 and other clinical outcomes were observed for IVA in G551D individuals, TEV-IVA and LUM-IVA in F508del homozygous individuals, and IVA in adults with a R117H mutation.",31076617,PMC6510767,10.1038/s41598-019-43652-2,,2019,"Habib AR, Kajbafzadeh M, Desai S, Yang CL, Skolnik K, Quon BS.",Y,MED
Do clinimetric properties of LCI change after correction of signal processing?,"Background: The recently described sensor-crosstalk error in the multiple-breath washout (MBW) device Exhalyzer D (Eco Medics AG) could highly influence clinimetric properties and the current interpretation of MBW results. This study reanalyzes MBW data from clinical routine in the corrected software version Spiroware® 3.3.1 and evaluates the effect on outcomes.Methods: We included nitrogen-MBW data from healthy children and children with cystic fibrosis (CF) from previously published trials and ongoing cohort studies. We specifically compared lung clearance index (LCI) analyzed in Spiroware 3.2.1 and 3.3.1 with regard to (i) feasibility, (ii) repeatability, and (iii) validity as outcome parameters in children with CF.Results: (i) All previously collected measurements could be reanalyzed and resulted in unchanged feasibility in Spiroware 3.3.1. (ii) Short- and midterm repeatability of LCI was similar in both software versions. (iii) Clinical validity of LCI remained similar in Spiroware 3.3.1; however, this resulted in lower values. Discrimination between health and disease was comparable between both software versions. The increase in LCI over time was less pronounced with 0.16 LCI units/year (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08; 0.24) versus 0.30 LCI units/year (95% CI 0.21; 0.38) in 3.2.1. Response to intervention in children receiving CF transmembrane conductance-modulator therapy resulted in a comparable improvement in LCI, in both Spiroware versions.Conclusion: Our study confirms that clinimetric properties of LCI remain unaffected after correction for the cross-sensitivity error in Spiroware software.",35182057,PMC9314934,10.1002/ppul.25865,,2022,"Frauchiger BS, Oestreich MA, Wyler F, Monney N, Willers C, Yammine S, Latzin P.",Y,MED
Oscillometry of the respiratory system: a translational opportunity not to be missed.,"Airway oscillometry has become the de facto standard for quality assessment of lung physiology in laboratory animals and has demonstrated its usefulness in understanding diseases of small airways. Nowadays, it is seeing extensive use in daily clinical practice and research; however, a question that remains unanswered is how well physiological findings in animals and humans correlate? Methodological and device differences are obvious between animal and human studies. However, all devices deliver an oscillated airflow test signal and output respiratory impedance. In addition, despite analysis differences, there are ways to interpret animal and human oscillometry data to allow suitable comparisons. The potential with oscillometry is its ability to reveal universal features of the respiratory system across species, making translational extrapolation likely to be predictive. This means that oscillometry can thus help determine if an animal model displays the same physiological characteristics as the human disease. Perhaps more importantly, it can also be useful to determine whether an intervention is effective as well as to understand if it affects the desired region of the respiratory system, e.g., the periphery of the lung. Finally, findings in humans can also inform preclinical scientists and give indications as to what type of physiological changes should be observed in animal models to make them relevant as models of human disease. The present article will attempt to demonstrate the potential of oscillometry in respiratory research, an area where the development of novel therapies is plagued with a failure rate higher than in other disease areas.",33822645,PMC8203417,10.1152/ajplung.00222.2020,,2021,"Lundblad LKA, Robichaud A.",Y,MED
Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes: optimizing care with a multidisciplinary approach.,"Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is a common complication of cystic fibrosis and can be present in over 50% of adults with the disease. CFRD is associated with poorer clinical outcomes, including accelerated pulmonary function decline and excess morbidity. The management of CFRD is complex and differs from that of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus such that clinicians responsible for the care of people with CFRD must work closely with colleagues across a number of different specialities and disciplines. This review aims to discuss why a multi-disciplinary approach is important and how it can be harnessed to optimize the care of people with CFRD.",31118718,PMC6499442,10.2147/dmso.s180597,,2019,"Frost F, Dyce P, Ochota A, Pandya S, Clarke T, Walshaw MJ, Nazareth DS.",Y,MED
Whole-Exome Sequencing Identified *CFTR* Variants in Two Consanguineous Families in China.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by genetic variants of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene. It is a common hereditary disease in Caucasians while rare in the Chinese. Until now, only 87 Chinese patients have been reported with molecular confirmations. The variant spectrum and clinical features of Chinese CF patients are obviously different from those of Caucasians.Materials and methods: Whole-exome sequencing was applied to analyze the exome of three individuals who have only the typical CF phenotype in the respiratory system from two consanguineous families. The protein domain and structure analysis were applied to predict the impact of the variants. Sanger sequencing was applied to validate the candidate variants.Results: A previously reported homozygous variant in *CFTR* (NM_000492.4: c.1000C > T, p.R334W) was identified in proband I. A novel homozygous variant in a polymorphic position (NM_000492.4: c.1409T > A, p.V470E) was identified in two individuals in the family II. The novel *CFTR* variant predicted to be disease-causing is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to be reported in *CFTR*. However, *in vitro* validation is still needed.Conclusion: Our finding expands the variant spectrum of *CFTR*, reveals clearer clinical phenotype distinction and variant spectrum distinction between Chinese and Caucasian CF patients, and contributes to a more rapid genetic diagnosis and future genetic counseling.",34276759,PMC8283821,10.3389/fgene.2021.631221,,2021,"Yang B, Lei C, Yang D, Tan Z, Guo T, Luo H.",Y,MED
Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasian populations. Individuals with CF have seen significant increases in life expectancy in the last 60 years. As a result, previously rare complications are now coming to light. The most common of these is cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD), which affects 40-50% of CF adults. CFRD significantly impacts the pulmonary function and longevity of CF patients, yet a lack of consensus on the best methods to diagnose and treat CFRD remains. We begin by reviewing our understanding of the pathogenesis of CFRD, as emerging evidence shows the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) also has important roles in the release of insulin and glucagon and in the protection of β cells from oxidative stress. We then discuss how current recommended methods of CFRD diagnosis are not appropriate, as continuous glucose monitoring becomes more effective, practical, and cost-effective. Finally, we evaluate emerging treatments which have narrowed the mortality gap within the CF patient group. In the future, pharmacological potentiators and correctors directly targeting CFTR show huge promise for both CFRD and the wider CF patient groups.",29515516,PMC5826202,10.3389/fendo.2018.00020,,2018,"Kayani K, Mohammed R, Mohiaddin H.",Y,MED
Two Siblings Homozygous for F508del-CFTR Have Varied Disease Phenotypes and Protein Biomarkers.,"Two siblings with CF are homozygous for F508del (referred to as Subject A and Subject B). Despite having the same CFTR genotype and similar environment, these two subjects exhibited different disease phenotypes. We analyzed their medical records and CF Foundation Registry data and measured inflammatory protein mediators in their sputum samples. Then, we examined the longitudinal relationships between inflammatory markers and disease severity for each subject and compared between them. Subject A presented a more severe disease than Subject B. During the study period, Subject A had two pulmonary exacerbations (PEs) whereas Subject B had one mild PE. The forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1, % predicted) values for Subject A were between 34-45% whereas for Subject B varied between 48-90%. Inflammatory protein mediators associated with neutrophils, Th1, Th2, and Th17 responses were elevated in sputum of Subject A compared with Subject B, and also in samples collected prior to and during PEs for both subjects. Neutrophilic elastase (NE) seemed to be the most informative biomarkers. The infectious burden between these two subjects was different.",33807880,PMC7961721,10.3390/ijms22052631,,2021,"Zhang Z, Wang J, Zhang YH, Gardner TE, Fitzpatrick EA, Zhang W.",Y,MED
Causal inference in survival analysis using longitudinal observational data: Sequential trials and marginal structural models.,"Longitudinal observational data on patients can be used to investigate causal effects of time-varying treatments on time-to-event outcomes. Several methods have been developed for estimating such effects by controlling for the time-dependent confounding that typically occurs. The most commonly used is marginal structural models (MSM) estimated using inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) (MSM-IPTW). An alternative, the sequential trials approach, is increasingly popular, and involves creating a sequence of ""trials"" from new time origins and comparing treatment initiators and non-initiators. Individuals are censored when they deviate from their treatment assignment at the start of each ""trial"" (initiator or noninitiator), which is accounted for using inverse probability of censoring weights. The analysis uses data combined across trials. We show that the sequential trials approach can estimate the parameters of a particular MSM. The causal estimand that we focus on is the marginal risk difference between the sustained treatment strategies of ""always treat"" vs ""never treat."" We compare how the sequential trials approach and MSM-IPTW estimate this estimand, and discuss their assumptions and how data are used differently. The performance of the two approaches is compared in a simulation study. The sequential trials approach, which tends to involve less extreme weights than MSM-IPTW, results in greater efficiency for estimating the marginal risk difference at most follow-up times, but this can, in certain scenarios, be reversed at later time points and relies on modelling assumptions. We apply the methods to longitudinal observational data from the UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry to estimate the effect of dornase alfa on survival.",37086186,PMC7614580,10.1002/sim.9718,,2023,"Keogh RH, Gran JM, Seaman SR, Davies G, Vansteelandt S.",Y,MED
Changes in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein expression prior to and during elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor therapy.,"**Background:** Defects in expression, maturation or function of the epithelial membrane glycoprotein CFTR are causative for the progressive disease cystic fibrosis. Recently, molecular therapeutics that improve CFTR maturation and functional defects have been approved. We aimed to verify whether we could detect an improvement of CFTR protein expression and maturation by triple therapy with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA). **Methods:** Rectal suction biopsies of 21 p.Phe508del homozygous or compound heterozygous CF patients obtained pre- and during treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA were analyzed by CFTR Western blot that was optimized to distinguish CFTR glycoisoforms. **Findings:** CFTR western immunoblot analysis revealed that-compared to baseline-the levels of CFTR protein increased by at least twofold in eight out of 12 patients upon treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA compared to baseline (*p* < 0.02). However, polydispersity of the mutant CFTR protein was lower than that of the fully glycosylated wild type CFTR Golgi isoform, indicating an incompletely glycosylated p.Phe508el CFTR protein isoform C* in patients with CF which persists after ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment. **Interpretation:** Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA increased protein expression by facilitating the posttranslational processing of mutant CFTR but apparently did not succeed in generating the polydisperse spectrum of N-linked oligosaccharides that is characteristic for the wild type CFTR band C glycoisoform. Our results caution that the lower amounts or immature glycosylation of the C* glycoisoform observed in patients' biomaterial might not translate to fully restored function of mutant CFTR necessary for long-term provision of clinical benefit.",36778025,PMC9911415,10.3389/fphar.2023.1114584,,2023,"Stanke F, Pallenberg ST, Tamm S, Hedtfeld S, Eichhorn EM, Minso R, Hansen G, Welte T, Sauer-Heilborn A, Ringshausen FC, Junge S, Tümmler B, Dittrich AM.",Y,MED
Functional respiratory imaging in relation to classical outcome measures in cystic fibrosis: a cross-sectional study.,"Background: Functional Respiratory Imaging (FRI) combines HRCT scans with computational fluid dynamics to provide objective and quantitative information about lung structure and function. FRI has proven its value in pulmonary diseases such as COPD and asthma, but limited studies have focused on cystic fibrosis (CF). This study aims to investigate the relation of multiple FRI parameters to validated imaging parameters and classical respiratory outcomes in a CF population.Methods: CF patients aged > 5 years scheduled for a chest CT were recruited in a cross-sectional study. FRI outcomes included regional airway volume, airway wall volume, airway resistance, lobar volume, air trapping and pulmonary blood distribution. Besides FRI, CT scans were independently evaluated by 2 readers using the CF-CT score. Spirometry and the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) were also performed. Statistical tests included linear mixed-effects models, repeated measures correlations, Pearson and Spearman correlations.Results: 39 CT scans of 24 (17M/7F) subjects were analyzed. Patients were 24 ± 9 years old and had a ppFEV1 of 71 ± 25% at the time of the first CT. All FRI parameters showed significant low-to-moderate correlations with the total CF-CT score, except for lobar volume. When considering the relation between FRI parameters and similar CF-CT subscores, significant correlations were found between parameters related to airway volume, air trapping and airway wall thickening. Air trapping, lobar volume after normal expiration and pulmonary blood distribution showed significant associations with all spirometric parameters and oxygen saturation at the end of 6MWT. In addition, air trapping was the only parameter related to the distance covered during 6MWT. A subgroup analysis showed considerably higher correlations in patients with mild lung disease (ppFEV1 ≥ 70%) compared to patients with moderate to severe lung disease (ppFEV1 < 70%) when comparing FRI to CF-CT scores.Conclusions: Multiple structural characteristics determined by FRI were associated with abnormalities determined by CF-CT score. Air trapping and pulmonary blood distribution appeared to be the most clinically relevant FRI parameters for CF patients due to their associations with classical outcome measures. The FRI methodology could particularly be of interest for patients with mild lung disease, although this should be confirmed in future research.",34348676,PMC8336350,10.1186/s12890-021-01622-3,,2021,"Lauwers E, Snoeckx A, Ides K, Van Hoorenbeeck K, Lanclus M, De Backer W, De Backer J, Verhulst S.",Y,MED
Real-World Outcomes Among Patients with Cystic Fibrosis Treated with Ivacaftor: 2012-2016 Experience.,"Introduction: In this long-term, postapproval, observational study, data from the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry and the UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry were used to evaluate the impact of ivacaftor treatment on cystic fibrosis (CF) by comparing outcomes in ivacaftor-treated patients with those in matched untreated comparator patients. Registry data from up to 5 years of ivacaftor availability in the US and up to 4 years of availability in the UK were evaluated.Methods: Starting in the first year of ivacaftor availability, ivacaftor-treated patients in each registry were matched 1:5 to comparator patients who never received ivacaftor. Clinical endpoints were evaluated in annual cross-sectional safety analyses. The key endpoints were death, organ transplants, pulmonary exacerbation, and hospitalization. Relative risks and 95% CIs were calculated to compare the ivacaftor and comparator cohorts in each registry.Results: Here, we report the complete and final results of the annual cross-sectional safety analyses across the duration of the study, with up to 5 years of follow-up. Data show a pattern of lower risk of death, transplant, pulmonary exacerbation, and hospitalization among ivacaftor-treated patients in both registries.Conclusions: Ivacaftor-treated patients had consistently favorable clinical outcomes relative to untreated comparators, and no new safety concerns were identified. While general limitations of observational research apply, these findings support disease modification by CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy with ivacaftor. Future research of novel CFTR modulators will need to explore alternative methods for comparator selection for evaluation of clinical data given the evolving landscape of CF treatment.",32304091,PMC7229122,10.1007/s41030-020-00115-8,,2020,"Higgins M, Volkova N, Moy K, Marshall BC, Bilton D.",Y,MED

Advances in Preclinical In Vitro Models for the Translation of Precision Medicine for Cystic Fibrosis.,"The development of preclinical in vitro models has provided significant progress to the studies of cystic fibrosis (CF), a frequently fatal monogenic disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Numerous cell lines were generated over the last 30 years and they have been instrumental not only in enhancing the understanding of CF pathological mechanisms but also in developing therapies targeting the underlying defects in CFTR mutations with further validation in patient-derived samples. Furthermore, recent advances toward precision medicine in CF have been made possible by optimizing protocols and establishing novel assays using human bronchial, nasal and rectal tissues, and by progressing from two-dimensional monocultures to more complex three-dimensional culture platforms. These models also enable to potentially predict clinical efficacy and responsiveness to CFTR modulator therapies at an individual level. In parallel, advanced systems, such as induced pluripotent stem cells and organ-on-a-chip, continue to be developed in order to more closely recapitulate human physiology for disease modeling and drug testing. In this review, we have highlighted novel and optimized cell models that are being used in CF research to develop novel CFTR-directed therapies (or alternative therapeutic interventions) and to expand the usage of existing modulator drugs to common and rare CF-causing mutations.",36013270,PMC9409685,10.3390/jpm12081321,,2022,"Silva IAL, Laselva O, Lopes-Pacheco M.",Y,MED
Endolysosomal Cation Channels and Lung Disease.,"Endolysosomal cation channels are emerging as key players of endolysosomal function such as endolysosomal trafficking, fusion/fission, lysosomal pH regulation, autophagy, lysosomal exocytosis, and endocytosis. Diseases comprise lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) and neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic diseases, pigmentation defects, cancer, immune disorders, autophagy related diseases, infectious diseases and many more. Involvement in lung diseases has not been a focus of attention so far but recent developments in the field suggest critical functions in lung physiology and pathophysiology. Thus, loss of TRPML3 was discovered to exacerbate emphysema formation and cigarette smoke induced COPD due to dysregulated matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP-12) levels in the extracellular matrix of the lung, a known risk factor for emphysema/COPD. While direct lung function measurements with the exception of TRPML3 are missing for other endolysosomal cation channels or channels expressed in lysosome related organelles (LRO) in the lung, links between those channels and important roles in lung physiology have been established such as the role of P2X4 in surfactant release from alveolar epithelial Type II cells. Other channels with demonstrated functions and disease relevance in the lung such as TRPM2, TRPV2, or TRPA1 may mediate their effects due to plasma membrane expression but evidence accumulates that these channels might also be expressed in endolysosomes, suggesting additional and/or dual roles of these channels in cell and intracellular membranes. We will discuss here the current knowledge on cation channels residing in endolysosomes or LROs with respect to their emerging roles in lung disease.",35053420,PMC8773812,10.3390/cells11020304,,2022,"Spix B, Jeridi A, Ansari M, Yildirim AÖ, Schiller HB, Grimm C.",Y,MED
The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator Controls Tolerogenic Responses to Food Allergens in Mice and Humans,"IgE antibodies against the allergen Ara-h2 can cause life-threatening anaphylaxis upon exposure to peanuts. Desensitization strategies aim at inducing IgG responses against Ara-h2 which may compete with anaphylactogenic IgE. Here we assessed anti-Ara-h2 titers in an unselected cohort of 24,536 adult patients admitted to a general hospital for disparate medical reasons. Surprisingly, adult (n=177) and pediatric (n=76) patients with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) had IgG4, but not IgE, against several peanut and soybean allergens, yet did not suffer from peanut allergy. Antibody repertoires were not globally perturbed in pwCF, and heterozygous Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator ( CFTR ) mutation carriers had the same prevalence of food allergies as pwCF. Peanut sensitisation of Cftr -/- mice failed to induce IgE and was associated with elevated IFN-γ. We conclude that CFTR is a key regulator of anaphylactogenic and tolerogenic responses to food allergens. CFTR-controlled cytokine responses including IFN-γ, in combination with a compromised epithelial barrier, may trigger a preferential IgG4 response resulting in tolerance to food allergens. Highlights: We investigated serum IgG against Ara-h2 in 24,536 patients and identified 133 seropositives. Seropositivity was associated with cystic fibrosis, and these patients had IgG4 but not IgE. We reproduced these results in a paediatric validation cohort and in a Cftr -/- mouse model. A compromised epithelial barrier and the cytokine milieu might explain this phenotype.",,,10.1101/2024.06.17.24309019,,2024,"Emmenegger M, Zografou C, Dai Y, Hoyt LR, Gudneppanavar R, Chincisan A, Rehrauer H, Noé FJ, Zajac N, Meisl G, Schneider MM, Nguyen H, Höpker K, Knowles TPJ, Sospedra M, Martin R, Ring AM, Leeds S, Eisenbarth SC, Egan ME, Bruscia EM, Aguzzi A.",Y,PPR
Update on the management of vitamins and minerals in cystic fibrosis.,"Advancements in respiratory and nutrition management have significantly improved the survival of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). With the availability of several nutrition interventions such as oral/enteral nutrition supplements, enteric-coated pancreatic enzymes, and water-miscible CF-specific vitamin supplements, frank vitamin deficiencies-with the exception of vitamin D-are rarely encountered in current clinical practice. Whereas they were previously considered as micronutrients, our current understanding of fat-soluble vitamins and minerals as antioxidants, immunomodulators, and disease biomarkers has been evolving. The impact of highly effective modulators on the micronutrient status of patients with CF remains elusive. This narrative review focuses on the updates on the management of fat-soluble vitamins and other micronutrients in CF in the current era and identifies the gaps in our knowledge.",35997322,PMC9544449,10.1002/ncp.10899,,2022,"Sankararaman S, Hendrix SJ, Schindler T.",Y,MED
Translating in vitro CFTR rescue into small molecule correctors for cystic fibrosis using the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures drug discovery platform.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The common ΔF508-CFTR mutation results in protein misfolding and proteasomal degradation. If ΔF508-CFTR trafficks to the cell surface, its anion channel function may be partially restored. Several in vitro strategies can partially correct ΔF508-CFTR trafficking and function, including low-temperature, small molecules, overexpression of miR-138, or knockdown of SIN3A. The challenge remains to translate such interventions into therapies and to understand their mechanisms. One approach for connecting such interventions to small molecule therapies that has previously succeeded for CF and other diseases is via mRNA expression profiling and iterative searches of small molecules with similar expression signatures. Here, we query the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures using transcriptomic signatures from previously generated CF expression data, including RNAi- and low temperature-based rescue signatures. This LINCS in silico screen prioritized 135 small molecules that mimicked our rescue interventions based on their genomewide transcriptional perturbations. Functional screens of these small molecules identified eight compounds that partially restored ΔF508-CFTR function, as assessed by cAMP-activated chloride conductance. Of these, XL147 rescued ΔF508-CFTR function in primary CF airway epithelia, while also showing cooperativity when administered with C18. Improved CF corrector therapies are needed and this integrative drug prioritization approach offers a novel method to both identify small molecules that may rescue ΔF508-CFTR function and identify gene networks underlying such rescue.",34877817,PMC8846631,10.1002/psp4.12751,,2022,"Strub MD, Ramachandran S, Boudko DY, Meleshkevitch EA, Pezzulo AA, Subramanian A, Liberzon A, Bridges RJ, McCray PB.",Y,MED
Modeling long-term health outcomes of patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del-CFTR treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor.,"Background: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination therapy is efficacious and generally safe for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygous for the F508del-CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation. However, long-term survival benefits of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) cannot yet be quantified. Simulation models can provide predictions about long-term health outcomes. In this study, we aimed to project long-term health outcomes of LUM/IVA plus standard care (SC) in patients with CF homozygous for F508del-CFTR.Methods: This modeling study was an individual patient simulation in US patients aged ⩾6 years with CF, homozygous for F508del-CFTR. The primary outcome was projected survival among (a) a cohort of patients who ever initiated LUM/IVA, accounting for treatment discontinuations, and (b) a cohort of patients who remain on continuous LUM/IVA. Patient characteristics and model parameters were derived from clinical trials: VX14-809-109, VX13-809-011B, TRAFFIC/TRANSPORT, and PROGRESS; published literature; and the US CF Foundation Patient Registry.Results: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor + SC is expected to increase median survival by 6.1 years versus SC alone, accounting for treatment discontinuations. The incremental median predicted survival versus SC assuming initiation of LUM/IVA at ages 6, 12, 18, and 25 years was 17.7, 12.6, 8.0, and 3.8 years, respectively. Assuming lifetime treatment with LUM/IVA, incremental median survival was predicted to be 7.8 years longer in the LUM/IVA + SC cohort. Initiating LUM/IVA at ages 6, 12, 18, and 25 years and assuming lifetime treatment resulted in incremental median predicted survival of 23.4, 18.2, 11.0, and 4.8 years, respectively.Conclusions: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor is projected to increase survival for patients with CF. Initiation at an early age and treatment persistence result in further increments in projected survival.",30803355,PMC6366006,10.1177/1753466618820186,,2019,"Rubin JL, O'Callaghan L, Pelligra C, Konstan MW, Ward A, Ishak JK, Chandler C, Liou TG.",Y,MED
Anti-Infectives Restore ORKAMBI® Rescue of F508del-CFTR Function in Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells Infected with Clinical Strains of *P. aeruginosa*.,"Chronic infection and inflammation are the primary causes of declining lung function in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. ORKAMBI® (Lumacaftor-Ivacaftor) is an approved combination therapy for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients bearing the most common mutation, F508del, in the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. It has been previously shown that ORKAMBI®-mediated rescue of CFTR is reduced by a pre-existing *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infection. Here, we show that the infection of F508del-CFTR human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells with lab strain and four different clinical strains of *P. aeruginosa,* isolated from the lung sputum of CF patients, decreases CFTR function in a strain-specific manner by 48 to 88%. The treatment of infected cells with antibiotic tobramycin or cationic antimicrobial peptide 6K-F17 was found to decrease clinical strain bacterial growth on HBE cells and restore ORKAMBI®-mediated rescue of F508del-CFTR function. Further, 6K-F17 was found to downregulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in infected HBE cells. The results provide strong evidence for a combination therapy approach involving CFTR modulators and anti-infectives (i.e., tobramycin and/or 6K-F17) to improve their overall efficacy in CF patients.",32092967,PMC7072183,10.3390/biom10020334,,2020,"Laselva O, Stone TA, Bear CE, Deber CM.",Y,MED
Real-World Long-Term Ivacaftor for Cystic Fibrosis in France: Clinical Effectiveness and Healthcare Resource Utilization.,"Introduction: Ivacaftor is a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator that has demonstrated clinical benefits in phase 3 trials. We report results from a real-world study (BRIO) to assess the effectiveness of ivacaftor in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) in France.Methods: BRIO was an observational study conducted at 35 centers in France. Both pwCF initiating ivacaftor treatment and those already taking ivacaftor were included and prospectively followed for 24 months. The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV1); secondary objectives were evaluating the effect of ivacaftor on clinical effectiveness, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and safety.Results: A total of 129 pwCF were enrolled; 58.9% were aged < 18 years; 64.3% had a G551D-CFTR allele. Mean age at ivacaftor initiation was 19.1 years (range, 2-64 years); ppFEV1 increased by a least squares mean of 8.49 percentage points in the first 6 months and was sustained through 36 months of ivacaftor use. Growth metrics increased during the first 12 months post-ivacaftor and remained stable. The rate of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) decreased during the 12 months post-ivacaftor compared with the 12 months pre-ivacaftor; estimated rate ratios (95% CI) were 0.57 (0.43-0.75) for PEx events and 0.25 (0.13-0.48) for PEx requiring hospitalization. No new safety concerns were identified; no deaths occurred.Conclusions: The results from this real-world study of ivacaftor usage in France were consistent with prior clinical trial outcomes, confirming the clinical effectiveness of ivacaftor, as well as an associated reduction in HCRU.",34101145,PMC8589905,10.1007/s41030-021-00158-5,,2021,"Hubert D, Marguet C, Benichou J, DeSouza C, Payen-Champenois C, Kinnman N, Chandarana K, Munck A, Fajac I, BRIO Study Group.",Y,MED
Enhanced Expression of Human Epididymis Protein 4 (HE4) Reflecting Pro-Inflammatory Status Is Regulated by CFTR in Cystic Fibrosis Bronchial Epithelial Cells.,"Decreased human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) plasma levels were reported in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients under CFTR potentiator *ivacaftor* therapy, which inversely correlated with lung function improvement. In this study, we investigated whether HE4 expression was affected via modulation of CFTR function in CF bronchial epithelial (CFBE) cells *in vitro*. HE4 protein levels were measured in the supernatants of CFBE 41o- cells expressing F508del-CFTR or wild-type CFTR (wt-CFTR) after administration of *lumacaftor/ivacaftor* or *tezacaftor/ivacaftor*, while HE4 expression in CFBE 41o- cells were also analyzed following application of adenylate cyclase activators Forskolin/IBMX or CFTRinh172. The effect of all of these compounds on CFTR function was monitored by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Induced HE4 expression was studied with interleukin-6 (IL-6) in F508del-CFTR CFBE 41o- cells under TNF-α stimulation for 1 h up to 1 week in duration. In parallel, plasma HE4 was determined in CF subjects homozygous for *p.Phe508del-CFTR* mutation receiving *lumacaftor/ivacaftor* (Orkambi®) therapy. NF-κB-mediated signaling was observed via the nuclear translocation of p65 subunit by fluorescence microscopy together with the analysis of IL-6 expression by an immunoassay. In addition, HE4 expression was examined after NF-κB pathway inhibitor BAY 11-7082 treatment with or without CFTR modulators. CFTR modulators partially restored the activity of F508del-CFTR and reduced HE4 concentration was found in F508del-CFTR CFBE 41o- cells that was close to what we observed in CFBE 41o- cells with wt-CFTR. These data were in agreement with decreased plasma HE4 concentrations in CF patients treated with Orkambi®. Furthermore, CFTR inhibitor induced elevated HE4 levels, while CFTR activator Forskolin/IBMX downregulated HE4 in the cell cultures and these effects were more pronounced in the presence of CFTR modulators. Higher activation level of baseline and TNF-α stimulated NF-κB pathway was detected in F508del-CFTR vs. wt-CFTR CFBE 41o- cells that was substantially reduced by CFTR modulators based on lower p65 nuclear positivity and IL-6 levels. Finally, HE4 expression was upregulated by TNF-α with elevated IL-6, and both protein levels were suppressed by combined administration of NF-κB pathway inhibitor and CFTR modulators in CFBE 41o- cells. In conclusion, CFTR dysfunction contributes to abnormal HE4 expression via NF-κB in CF.",34054511,PMC8160512,10.3389/fphar.2021.592184,,2021,"Bene Z, Fejes Z, Szanto TG, Fenyvesi F, Váradi J, Clarke LA, Panyi G, Macek M, Amaral MD, Balogh I, Nagy B.",Y,MED

Genetic and phenotypic traits of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis in Southern Brazil.,"Objectives: To characterize the main identified mutations on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in a group of children and adolescents at a cystic fibrosis center and its association with the clinical and laboratorial characteristics.Method: Descriptive cross-sectional study including patients with cystic fibrosis who had two alleles identified with CFTR mutation. Clinical, anthropometrical, laboratorial and pulmonary function (spirometry) data were collected from patients' records in charts and described with the results of the sample genotyping.Results: 42 patients with cystic fibrosis were included in the study. The most frequent mutation was F508del, covering 60 alleles (71.4%). The second most common mutation was G542X (six alleles, 7.1%), followed by N1303K and R1162X mutations (both with four alleles each). Three patients (7.14%) presented type III and IV mutations, and 22 patients (52.38%) presented homozygous mutation for F508del. Thirty three patients (78.6%) suffered of pancreatic insufficiency, 26.2% presented meconium ileus, and 16.7%, nutritional deficit. Of the patients in the study, 59.52% would be potential candidates for the use of CFTR-modulating drugs.Conclusions: The mutations of CFTR identified more frequently were F508del and G542X. These are type II and I mutations, respectively. Along with type III, they present a more severe cystic fibrosis phenotype. More than half of the sample (52.38%) presented homozygous mutation for F508del, that is, patients who could be treated with Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor. Approximately 7% of the patients (7.14%) presented type III and IV mutations, therefore becoming candidates for the treatment with Ivacaftor.",30726326,PMC6459751,10.1590/s1806-37562017000000418,,2018,"Rosa KMD, Lima EDS, Machado CC, Rispoli T, Silveira VD, Ongaratto R, Comaru T, Pinto LA.",Y,MED
Posaconazole-Induced Hypertension Masquerading as Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia in a Child with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Background: Deficiency of 11*β*-hydroxylase is the second most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), presenting with hypertension, hypokalaemia, precocious puberty, and adrenal insufficiency. We report the case of a 6-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis (CF) found to have hypertension and cortisol insufficiency, which were initially suspected to be due to CAH, but were subsequently identified as being secondary to posaconazole therapy. *Case Presentation*. A 6-year-old boy with CF was noted to have developed hypertension after administration of two doses of Orkambi™ (ivacaftor/lumacaftor), which was subsequently discontinued, but the hypertension persisted. Further investigations, including echocardiogram, abdominal Doppler, thyroid function, and urinary catecholamine levels, were normal. A urine steroid profile analysis raised the possibility of CAH due to 11*β*-hydroxylase deficiency, and a standard short synacthen test (SST) revealed suboptimal cortisol response. Clinically, there were no features of androgen excess. Detailed evaluation of the medical history revealed exposure to posaconazole for more than 2 months, and the hypertension had been noted to develop two weeks after the initiation of posaconazole. Hence, posaconazole was discontinued, following which the blood pressure, cortisol response to the SST, and urine steroid profile were normalized.Conclusion: Posaconazole can induce a clinical and biochemical picture similar to CAH due to 11*β*-hydroxylase deficiency, which is reversible. It is prudent to monitor patients on posaconazole for cortisol insufficiency, hypertension, and electrolyte abnormalities.",32908540,PMC7474764,10.1155/2020/8153012,,2020,"Agarwal N, Apperley L, Taylor NF, Taylor DR, Ghataore L, Rumsby E, Treslove C, Holt R, Thursfield R, Senniappan S.",Y,MED
Novel therapeutic approaches for the management of cystic fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition characterised by the build-up of thick, sticky mucus that can damage many of the body's organs. It is a life-long disease that results in a shortened life expectancy, often due to the progression of advanced lung disease. Treatment has previously targeted the downstream symptoms such as diminished mucus clearance and recurrent infection. More recently, significant advances have been made in treating the cause of the disease by targeting the faulty gene responsible. Hope for the development of potential therapies lies with ongoing research into new pharmacological agents and gene therapy. This review gives an overview of CF, and summarises the current evidence regarding the disease management and upcoming strategies aimed at treating or potentially curing this condition.",33282281,PMC7706361,10.4081/mrm.2020.690,,2020,"Jaques R, Shakeel A, Hoyle C.",Y,MED
Proximity Profiling of the CFTR Interaction Landscape in Response to Orkambi.,"Deletion of phenylalanine 508 (∆F508) of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) anion channel protein is the leading cause of Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Here, we report the analysis of CFTR and ∆F508-CFTR interactomes using BioID (proximity-dependent biotin identification), a technique that can also detect transient associations. We identified 474 high-confidence CFTR proximity-interactors, 57 of which have been previously validated, with the remainder representing novel interaction space. The ∆F508 interactome, comprising 626 proximity-interactors was markedly different from its wild type counterpart, with numerous alterations in protein associations categorized in membrane trafficking and cellular stress functions. Furthermore, analysis of the ∆F508 interactome in cells treated with Orkambi identified several interactions that were altered as a result of this drug therapy. We examined two candidate CFTR proximity interactors, VAPB and NOS1AP, in functional assays designed to assess surface delivery and overall chloride efflux. VAPB depletion impacted both CFTR surface delivery and chloride efflux, whereas NOS1AP depletion only affected the latter. The wild type and ∆F508-CFTR interactomes represent rich datasets that could be further mined to reveal additional candidates for the functional rescue of ∆F508-CFTR.",35269585,PMC8910062,10.3390/ijms23052442,,2022,"Iazzi M, Astori A, St-Germain J, Raught B, Gupta GD, Gupta GD.",Y,MED

Fungal Infection and Inflammation in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Fungi are frequently recovered from lower airway samples from people with cystic fibrosis (CF), yet the role of fungi in the progression of lung disease is debated. Recent studies suggest worsening clinical outcomes associated with airway fungal detection, although most studies to date are retrospective or observational. The presence of fungi can elicit a T helper cell type 2 (Th-2) mediated inflammatory reaction known as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), particularly in those with a genetic atopic predisposition. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of fungal infections in people with CF, risk factors associated with development of fungal infections, and microbiologic approaches for isolation and identification of fungi. We review the spectrum of fungal disease presentations, clinical outcomes after isolation of fungi from airway samples, and the importance of considering airway co-infections. Finally, we discuss the association between fungi and airway inflammation highlighting gaps in knowledge and future research questions that may further elucidate the role of fungus in lung disease progression.",34069863,PMC8157353,10.3390/pathogens10050618,,2021,"Poore TS, Hong G, Zemanick ET.",Y,MED
Infection prevention and chronic disease management in cystic fibrosis and noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.,"Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung disease (CLD) characterized by irreversible bronchial dilatation noted on computed tomography associated with chronic cough, ongoing viscid sputum production, and recurrent pulmonary infections. Patients with bronchiectasis can be classified into two groups: those with cystic fibrosis and those without cystic fibrosis. Individuals with either cystic fibrosis related bronchiectasis (CFRB) or noncystic fibrosis related bronchiectasis (NCFRB) experience continuous airway inflammation and suffer airway architectural changes that foster the acquisition of a unique polymicrobial community. The presence of microorganisms increases airway inflammation, triggers pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), reduces quality of life (QOL), and, in some cases, is an independent risk factor for increased mortality. As there is no cure for either condition, prevention and control of infection is paramount. Such an undertaking incorporates patient/family and healthcare team education, immunoprophylaxis, microorganism source control, antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis, organism eradication, daily pulmonary disease management, and, in some cases, thoracic surgery. This review is a summary of recommendations aimed to thwart patient acquisition of pathologic organisms, and those therapies known to mitigate the effects of chronic airway infection. A thorough discussion of airway clearance techniques and treatment of or screening for nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is beyond the scope of this discussion.",32160809,PMC7068740,10.1177/1753466620905272,,2020,Lommatzsch ST.,Y,MED
A Precision Medicine Approach to Optimize Modulator Therapy for Rare CFTR Folding Mutants.,"Trikafta, a triple-combination drug, consisting of folding correctors VX-661 (tezacaftor), VX-445 (elexacaftor) and the gating potentiator VX-770 (ivacaftor) provided unprecedented clinical benefits for patients with the most common cystic fibrosis (CF) mutation, F508del. Trikafta indications were recently expanded to additional 177 mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). To minimize life-long pharmacological and financial burden of drug administration, if possible, we determined the necessary and sufficient modulator combination that can achieve maximal benefit in preclinical setting for selected mutants. To this end, the biochemical and functional rescue of single corrector-responsive rare mutants were investigated in a bronchial epithelial cell line and patient-derived human primary nasal epithelia (HNE), respectively. The plasma membrane density of P67L-, L206W- or S549R-CFTR corrected by VX-661 or other type I correctors was moderately increased by VX-445. Short-circuit current measurements of HNE, however, uncovered that correction comparable to Trikafta was achieved for S549R-CFTR by VX-661 + VX-770 and for P67L- and L206W-CFTR by the VX-661 + VX-445 combination. Thus, introduction of a third modulator may not provide additional benefit for patients with a subset of rare CFTR missense mutations. These results also underscore that HNE, as a precision medicine model, enable the optimization of mutation-specific modulator combinations to maximize their efficacy and minimize life-long drug exposure of CF patients.",34357110,PMC8307171,10.3390/jpm11070643,,2021,"Veit G, Velkov T, Xu H, Vadeboncoeur N, Bilodeau L, Matouk E, Lukacs GL.",Y,MED
Molecular mechanisms of cystic fibrosis - how mutations lead to misfunction and guide therapy.,"Cystic fibrosis, the most common autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasians, is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes a cAMP-activated chloride and bicarbonate channel that regulates ion and water transport in secretory epithelia. Although all mutations lead to the lack or reduction in channel function, the mechanisms through which this occurs are diverse - ranging from lack of full-length mRNA, reduced mRNA levels, impaired folding and trafficking, targeting to degradation, decreased gating or conductance, and reduced protein levels to decreased half-life at the plasma membrane. Here, we review the different molecular mechanisms that cause cystic fibrosis and detail how these differences identify theratypes that can inform the use of directed therapies aiming at correcting the basic defect. In summary, we travel through CFTR life cycle from the gene to function, identifying what can go wrong and what can be targeted in terms of the different types of therapeutic approaches.",35707985,PMC9251585,10.1042/bsr20212006,,2022,"Farinha CM, Callebaut I.",Y,MED
Activity of lumacaftor is not conserved in zebrafish Cftr bearing the major cystic fibrosis-causing mutation.,"F508del-cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the major mutant responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF). ORKAMBI®, approved for patients bearing this mutant, contains lumacaftor (VX-809) that partially corrects F508del-CFTR's processing defect and ivacaftor (VX-770) that potentiates its defective channel activity. Unfortunately, the clinical efficacy of ORKAMBI® is modest, highlighting the need to understand how the small molecules work so that superior compounds can be developed. Because, human CFTR (hCFTR) and zebrafish Cftr (zCftr) are structurally conserved as determined in recent cryo-EM structural models, we hypothesized that the consequences of the major mutation and small molecule modulators would be similar for the two species of protein. As expected, like the F508del mutation in hCFTR, the homologous mutation in zCftr (F507del) is misprocessed, yet not as severely as the human mutant and this defect was restored by low-temperature (27°C) culture conditions. After rescue to the cell surface, F507del-zCftr exhibited regulated channel activity that was potentiated by ivacaftor. Surprisingly, lumacaftor failed to rescue misprocessing of the F507del-zCftr at either 37 or 27°C suggesting that future comparative studies with F508del-hCFTR would provide insight into its structure: function relationships. Interestingly, the robust rescue of F508del-zCftr at 27°C and availability of methods for in vivo screening in zebrafish present the opportunity to define the cellular pathways underlying rescue.",32123813,PMC6996396,10.1096/fba.2019-00039,,2019,"Laselva O, Erwood S, Du K, Ivakine Z, Bear CE.",Y,MED
Real-World Safety of CFTR Modulators in the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis: A Systematic Review.,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies target the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF), and are generally well-tolerated; however, real-world studies indicate the frequency of discontinuation and adverse events (AEs) may be higher than what was observed in clinical trials. The objectives of this systematic review were to summarize real-world AEs reported for market-available CFTR modulators (i.e., ivacaftor (IVA), lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA), tezacaftor/ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA), and elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA)), and to identify ways in which the pharmacist on CF healthcare teams may contribute to mitigating and managing these AEs. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science Core Collection online databases were searched from 2012 to Aug 1, 2020. Full manuscripts or conference abstracts of observational studies, case series, and case reports were eligible for inclusion. The included full manuscripts and conference abstracts comprised of 54 observational studies, 5 case series, and 9 case reports. The types of AEs reported generally aligned with what have been observed in clinical trials. LUM/IVA was associated with a higher frequency of respiratory-related AE and discontinuation in real-world studies. A signal for mental health and neurocognitive AEs was identified with all 4 CFTR modulators. A systematic approach to monitoring for AEs in people with CF on CFTR modulators in the real-world setting is necessary to help better understand potential AEs, as well as patient characteristics that may be associated with higher risk of certain AEs. Pharmacists play a key role in the safe initiation and monitoring of people with CF on CFTR modulator therapies.",33374882,PMC7795777,10.3390/jcm10010023,,2020,"Dagenais RVE, Su VCH, Quon BS.",Y,MED

F1099L-CFTR (c.3297C>G) has Impaired Channel Function and Associates with Mild Disease Phenotypes in Two Pediatric Patients.,"(1) Background: many rare *cystic fibrosis**transmembrane conductance regulator* (CFTR) mutations remain poorly characterized with regard to functional consequences of the mutation. We present the clinical features of two pediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) subjects who are heterozygous for F1099L (c.3297C>G), one with G551D (a class III mutation) and one with 3849 + 10kbC->T (a class V mutation). We also identified the molecular defect(s) that are associated with F1099L mutation to correlate with the clinical features that we observed; (2) Methods: clinical findings and history were extracted from the electronic medical record and de-identified. F1099L-CFTR protein expression level and maturation status, channel function, and the effects of CFTR modulation on these characteristics were investigated using western blotting and iodide efflux assay; (3) Results: these two subjects have mild CF phenotypes when F1099L is combined with two known disease-causing mutations. F1099L-CFTR has a moderate defect in processing and maturation, causing fewer CFTR channels at the cell surface and, therefore, impaired channel activities. These defects could be effectively corrected using VX-809 (lumacaftor); and, (4) Conclusions: our biochemical data correlate with the disease manifestations and suggest that F1099L is potentially a CF-causing mutation.

"Demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory features, and the distribution of pathogenic variants in the CFTR gene in the Cypriot cystic fibrosis (CF) population demonstrate the utility of a national CF patient registry.","Background: Specialized clinical care for cystic fibrosis (CF) in Cyprus, a small island country, has been implemented since the 1990s. However, only recently, a national CF patient registry has been established for the systematic recording of patients' data. In this study, we aim to present data on the epidemiological, genotypic and phenotypic features of CF patients in the country from the most recent data collection in 2019, with particular emphasis on notable rare or unique cases.Results: Overall, data from 52 patients are presented, 5 of whom have deceased and 13 have been lost to follow-up in previous years. The mean age at diagnosis was 7.2 ± 12.3 years, and the mean age of 34 alive patients by the end of 2019 was 22.6 ± 13.2 years. Patients most commonly presented at diagnosis with acute or persistent respiratory symptoms (46.2%), failure to thrive or malnutrition (40.4%), and dehydration or electrolyte imbalance (32.7%). Sweat chloride levels were diagnostic (above 60 mmol/L) in 81.8% of examined patients. The most common identified mutation was p.Phe508del (F508del) (45.2%), followed by p.Leu346Pro (L346P) (6.7%), a mutation detected solely in individuals of Cypriot descent. The mean BMI and FEV1 z-scores were 0.2 ± 1.3 and - 2.1 ± 1.7 across all age groups, respectively, whereas chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization was noted in 26.9% of patients. The majority of patients (74.5%) were eligible to receive at least one of the available CFTR modulator therapies. In 25% of patients we recovered rare or unique genotypic profiles, including the endemic p.Leu346Pro (L346P), the rare CFTR-dup2, the co-segregated c.4200_4201delTG/c.489 + 3A > G, and the polymorphism p.Ser877Ala.Conclusions: CF patient registries are particularly important in small or isolated populations, such as in Cyprus, with rare or unique disease cases.

An innovative phase II trial to establish proof of efficacy and optimal dose of a new inhaled epithelial sodium channel inhibitor BI 1265162 in adults and adolescents with cystic fibrosis: BALANCE-CFTM 1.,"Inhibition of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) represents an important, mutation-agnostic therapeutic approach to restore airway surface liquid in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). A phase II trial of the ENaC inhibitor BI 1265162, inhaled *via* the Respimat® Soft Mist™ inhaler, in patients aged ≥12 years with CF is being conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of BI 1265162, on top of standard CF treatment (www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04059094). BALANCE-CF™ 1 is a multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging trial consisting of 2 weeks' screening, 4 weeks' randomised treatment and 1 week follow-up. 98 patients, including ≥21 adolescents, will be randomised. First, 28 patients will be allocated to the highest dose of BI 1265162 (200 µg twice daily) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The remaining 70 patients will be allocated to one of five treatment arms (200 µg, 100 µg, 50 µg, 20 µg or placebo twice daily), with a final distribution ratio of 2:1:1:1:2. Recruitment and randomisation will begin with adult patients. An independent data monitoring committee will review safety data to advise on inclusion of adolescents and study continuation. A futility analysis will be conducted after 28 patients to prevent exposure of further patients in case of insufficient evidence of clinical efficacy. The design ensures that potential for effect is assessed ahead of wider enrolment, allowing investigation of a dose-response effect with minimal patient numbers.

The combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis: clinical evidence and future prospects in cystic fibrosis therapy.,"Years of tremendous study have dawned a new era for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). For years CF care was rooted in the management of organ dysfunction resulting from the mal-effects of absent anion transport through the CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR) protein. CFTR, an adenosine triphosphate binding anion channel, has multiple functions, but primarily regulates the movement of chloride anions, thiocyanate and bicarbonate across luminal cell membranes. Additional roles include effects on other electrolyte channels such as the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and on pulmonary innate immunity. Inappropriate luminal anion movement leads to elevated sweat chloride concentrations, dehydrated airway surface liquid, overall viscous mucous production, and inspissated bile and pancreatic secretions. As a result, patients develop the well-known CF symptoms and disease-defining complications such as chronic cough, oily stools, recurrent pulmonary infections, bronchiectasis, chronic sinusitis and malnutrition. Traditionally, CF has been symptomatically managed, but over the past 6 years those with CF have been offered a new mode of therapy; CFTR protein modulation. These medications affect the basic defect in CF: abnormal CFTR function. Ivacaftor, approved for use in the United States in 2012, is the first medication in CF history to improve CFTR function at the molecular level. Its study and approval were followed by two additional CFTR modulators, lumacaftor/ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor. To effectively use currently available CF therapies, clinicians should be familiar with the side effects of the drugs and their impacts on patient outcomes. As many new modulators are on the horizon, this information will equip providers to discuss the benefits and shortcomings of modulator therapy especially in the context of limited healthcare resources.",31027466,PMC6487765,10.1177/1753466619844424,,2019,"Lommatzsch ST, Taylor-Cousar JL.",Y,MED
Molecular Dynamics and Theratyping in Airway and Gut Organoids Reveal R352Q-CFTR Conductance Defect.,"A significant challenge to making targeted cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies accessible to all individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) are many mutations in the *CFTR* gene that can cause CF, most of which remain uncharacterized. Here, we characterized the structural and functional defects of the rare *CFTR* mutation R352Q, with a potential role contributing to intrapore chloride ion permeation, in patient-derived cell models of the airway and gut. CFTR function in differentiated nasal epithelial cultures and matched intestinal organoids was assessed using an ion transport assay and forskolin-induced swelling assay, respectively. CFTR potentiators (VX-770, GLPG1837, and VX-445) and correctors (VX-809, VX-445, with or without VX-661) were tested. Data from R352Q-CFTR were compared with data of 20 participants with mutations with known impact on CFTR function. R352Q-CFTR has residual CFTR function that was restored to functional CFTR activity by CFTR potentiators but not the corrector. Molecular dynamics simulations of R352Q-CFTR were carried out, which indicated the presence of a chloride conductance defect, with little evidence supporting a gating defect. The combination approach of *in vitro* patient-derived cell models and *in silico* molecular dynamics simulations to characterize rare *CFTR* mutations can improve the specificity and sensitivity of modulator response predictions and aid in their translational use for CF precision medicine.",35471184,PMC9273222,10.1165/rcmb.2021-0337oc,,2022,"Wong SL, Awatade NT, Astore MA, Allan KM, Carnell MJ, Slapetova I, Chen PC, Setiadi J, Pandzic E, Fawcett LK, Widger JR, Whan RM, Griffith R, Ooi CY, Kuyucak S, Jaffe A, Waters SA.",Y,MED

Pulmonary Outcomes Associated with Long-Term Azithromycin Therapy in Cystic Fibrosis.,"**Rationale:** Chronic azithromycin is commonly used in cystic fibrosis based on short controlled clinical trials showing reductions in pulmonary exacerbations and improved FEV1. Long-term effects are unknown.**Objectives:** Examine pulmonary outcomes among chronic azithromycin users compared with matched controls over years of use and consider combined azithromycin use in cohorts using chronic inhaled tobramycin or aztreonam.**Methods:** This retrospective cohort study used the U.S. cystic fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry. Incident chronic azithromycin users were compared with matched controls by FEV1% predicted rate of decline and rates of intravenous antibiotic use to treat pulmonary exacerbations. Propensity score methods were utilized to address confounding by indication. Predefined sensitivity analyses based on lung function, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (PA) status, and follow-up time intervals were conducted.**Measurements and Main Results:** Across 3 years, FEV1% predicted per-year decline was nearly 40% less in those with PA using azithromycin compared with matched controls (slopes, -1.53 versus -2.41% predicted per yr; difference: 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-1.47). This rate of decline did not differ based on azithromycin use in those without PA. Among all cohorts, use of intravenous antibiotics was no different between azithromycin users and controls. Users of inhaled tobramycin and azithromycin had FEV1% predicted per-year decline of -0.16 versus nonusers (95% CI, -0.44 to 0.13), whereas users of inhaled aztreonam lysine and azithromycin experienced a mean 0.49% predicted per year slower decline than matched controls (95% CI, -0.11 to 1.10).**Conclusions:** Results from this study provide additional rationale for chronic azithromycin use in PA-positive patients to reduce lung function decline.",31661302,PMC7049934,10.1164/rccm.201906-1206oc,,2020,"Nichols DP, Odem-Davis K, Cogen JD, Goss CH, Ren CL, Skalland M, Somayaji R, Heltshe SL.",Y,MED
The Changing Face of Cystic Fibrosis and Its Implications for Screening.,"Early diagnosis, multidisciplinary care, and optimized and preventive treatments have changed the face of cystic fibrosis.

Airway Redox Homeostasis and Inflammation Gone Awry: From Molecular Pathogenesis to Emerging Therapeutics in Respiratory Pathology.,"As aerobic organisms, we are continuously and throughout our lifetime subjected to an oxidizing atmosphere and, most often, to environmental threats. The lung is the internal organ most highly exposed to this milieu. Therefore, it has evolved to confront both oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a variety of pollutants, pathogens, and allergens that promote inflammation and can harm the airways to different degrees. Indeed, an excess of ROS, generated intrinsically or from external sources, can imprint direct damage to key structural cell components (nucleic acids, sugars, lipids, and proteins) and indirectly perturb ROS-mediated signaling in lung epithelia, impairing its homeostasis. These early events complemented with efficient recognition of pathogen- or damage-associated recognition patterns by the airway resident cells alert the immune system, which mounts an inflammatory response to remove the hazards, including collateral dead cells and cellular debris, in an attempt to return to homeostatic conditions. Thus, any major or chronic dysregulation of the redox balance, the air-liquid interface, or defects in epithelial proteins impairing mucociliary clearance or other defense systems may lead to airway damage. Here, we review our understanding of the key role of oxidative stress and inflammation in respiratory pathology, and extensively report current and future trends in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory treatments focusing on the following major acute and chronic lung diseases: acute lung injury/respiratory distress syndrome, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and cystic fibrosis.",33297418,PMC7731288,10.3390/ijms21239317,,2020,"Checa J, Aran JM.",Y,MED
Oral cysteamine as an adjunct treatment in cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations: An exploratory randomized clinical trial.,"Background: Emerging data suggests a possible role for cysteamine as an adjunct treatment for pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (CF) that continue to be a major clinical challenge. There are no studies investigating the use of cysteamine in pulmonary exacerbations of CF. This exploratory randomized clinical trial was conducted to answer the question: In future pivotal trials of cysteamine as an adjunct treatment in pulmonary exacerbations of CF, which candidate cysteamine dosing regimens should be tested and which are the most appropriate, clinically meaningful outcome measures to employ as endpoints?Methods and findings: Multicentre double-blind randomized clinical trial. Adults experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation of CF being treated with standard care that included aminoglycoside therapy were randomized equally to a concomitant 14-day course of placebo, or one of 5 dosing regimens of cysteamine. Outcomes were recorded on days 0, 7, 14 and 21 and included sputum bacterial load and the patient reported outcome measures (PROMs): Chronic Respiratory Infection Symptom Score (CRISS), the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R); FEV1, blood leukocyte count, and inflammatory markers. Eighty nine participants in fifteen US and EU centres were randomized, 78 completed the 14-day treatment period. Cysteamine had no significant effect on sputum bacterial load, however technical difficulties limited interpretation. The most consistent findings were for cysteamine 450mg twice daily that had effects additional to that observed with placebo, with improved symptoms, CRISS additional 9.85 points (95% CI 0.02, 19.7) p = 0.05, reduced blood leukocyte count by 2.46x109 /l (95% CI 0.11, 4.80), p = 0.041 and reduced CRP by geometric mean 2.57 nmol/l (95% CI 0.15, 0.99), p = 0.049.Conclusion: In this exploratory study cysteamine appeared to be safe and well-tolerated.

"Clinical characteristics and outcomes in adult cystic fibrosis patients with severe lung disease in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil.","Background: Advanced lung disease in adult cystic fibrosis (CF) drives most clinical care requirements. The aim was to evaluate outcome (time to death while in the study) in a cohort of adult CF patients with severe lung disease, and to determine the association among baseline patient characteristics and outcome.Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed and clinical records between 2000 and 2015 were reviewed. Severe lung disease was defined as forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) < 30% of predicted. Outcomes of all patients, including their date of death or transplantation, were determined till January 1st, 2016. Clinical data were recorded at the entry date.Results: Among 39 subjects included in the study, 20 (51.3%) died, 16 (41.0%) underwent bilateral lung transplantation, and 3 were alive at the end of the study period. Two variables were independently associated with death: body mass index (BMI ≥ 18.5 kg/m2) (HR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.64-0.96 and p = 0.017) and use of tobramycin inhalation therapy (HR = 3.82, 95% CI = 1.38-10.6 and p = 0.010). Median survival was 37 (95% CI = 16.4-57.6) months. The best cut-off point for BMI was 18.5 kg/m2. Median survival in patients with BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 was 36 months (95% CI = 18.7-53.3).Conclusion: Median survival of CF subjects with FEV1 < 30% was 37 months. BMI and tobramycin inhalation therapy were independently associated with death. Median survival in patients with BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 was significantly lower than in patients with BMI ≥ 18.5 kg/m2.

Airway Epithelial Inflammation *In Vitro* Augments the Rescue of Mutant CFTR by Current CFTR Modulator Therapies.,"In cystic fibrosis (CF), defective biogenesis and activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) leads to airway dehydration and impaired mucociliary clearance, resulting in chronic airway infection and inflammation. The most common CFTR mutation, F508del, results in a processing defect in which the protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and does not reach the apical surface. CFTR corrector compounds address this processing defect to promote mutant CFTR transfer to the apical membrane. When coupled with potentiators to increase CFTR channel activity, these drugs yield significant clinical benefits in CF patients carrying the F508del mutation. However, processing of CFTR and other proteins can be influenced by environmental factors such as inflammation, and the impact of airway inflammation on pharmacological activity of CFTR correctors is not established. The present study evaluated CFTR-rescuing therapies in inflamed CF airway epithelial cultures, utilizing models that mimic the inflammatory environment of CF airways. Primary bronchial epithelial cultures from F508del/F508del CF patients were inflamed by mucosal exposure to one of two inflammatory stimuli: 1) supernatant from mucopurulent material from CF airways with advanced lung disease, or 2) bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from pediatric CF patients. Cultures inflamed with either stimulus exhibited augmented F508del responses following therapy with correctors VX-809 or VX-661, and overcame the detrimental effects of chronic exposure to the CFTR potentiator VX-770. Remarkably, even the improved CFTR rescue responses resulting from a clinically effective triple therapy (VX-659/VX-661/VX-770) were enhanced by epithelial inflammation. Thus, the airway inflammatory milieu from late- and early-stage CF lung disease improves the efficacy of CFTR modulators, regardless of the combination therapy used. Our findings suggest that pre-clinical evaluation of CFTR corrector therapies should be performed under conditions mimicking the native inflammatory status of CF airways, and altering the inflammatory status of CF airways may change the efficacy of CFTR modulator therapies.",33859562,PMC8042279,10.3389/fphar.2021.628722,,2021,"Gentzsch M, Cholon DM, Quinney NL, Martino MEB, Minges JT, Boyles SE, Guhr Lee TN, Esther CR, Ribeiro CMP.",Y,MED
Transcriptomic and Proteostasis Networks of CFTR and the Development of Small Molecule Modulators for the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis Lung Disease.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene. The diversity of mutations and the multiple ways by which the protein is affected present challenges for therapeutic development. The observation that the Phe508del-CFTR mutant protein is temperature sensitive provided proof of principle that mutant CFTR could escape proteosomal degradation and retain partial function. Several specific protein interactors and quality control checkpoints encountered by CFTR during its proteostasis have been investigated for therapeutic purposes, but remain incompletely understood. Furthermore, pharmacological manipulation of many CFTR interactors has not been thoroughly investigated for the rescue of Phe508del-CFTR. However, high-throughput screening technologies helped identify several small molecule modulators that rescue CFTR from proteosomal degradation and restore partial function to the protein. Here, we discuss the current state of CFTR transcriptomic and biogenesis research and small molecule therapy development. We also review recent progress in CFTR proteostasis modulators and discuss how such treatments could complement current FDA-approved small molecules.",32414011,PMC7288469,10.3390/genes11050546,,2020,"Strub MD, McCray PB.",Y,MED

In this report we document the case of a homozygous F508del CF patient with severe lung disease who presented with a pulmonary exacerbation shortly after the beginning of treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and the complicated initial phase of therapy, which was followed by significant improvements.",30002941,PMC5998152,10.1155/2018/8394370,,2018,"Hatziagorou E, Kouroukli E, Georgopoulou V, Tsanakas J.",Y,MED
CFTR Correctors and Antioxidants Partially Normalize Lipid Imbalance but not Abnormal Basal Inflammatory Cytokine Profile in CF Bronchial Epithelial Cells.,"A deficiency in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function in CF leads to chronic lung disease. CF is associated with abnormalities in fatty acids, ceramides, and cholesterol, their relationship with CF lung pathology is not completely understood. Therefore, we examined the impact of CFTR deficiency on lipid metabolism and pro-inflammatory signaling in airway epithelium using mass spectrometric, protein array. We observed a striking imbalance in fatty acid and ceramide metabolism, associated with chronic oxidative stress under basal conditions in CF mouse lung and well-differentiated bronchial epithelial cell cultures of CFTR knock out pig and CF patients. Cell-autonomous features of all three CF models included high ratios of ω-6- to ω-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids and of long- to very long-chain ceramide species (LCC/VLCC), reduced levels of total ceramides and ceramide precursors. In addition to the retinoic acid analog fenretinide, the anti-oxidants glutathione (GSH) and deferoxamine partially corrected the lipid profile indicating that oxidative stress may promote the lipid abnormalities. CFTR-targeted modulators reduced the lipid imbalance and oxidative stress, confirming the CFTR dependence of lipid ratios. However, despite functional correction of CF cells up to 60% of non-CF in Ussing chamber experiments, a 72-h triple compound treatment (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor surrogate) did not completely normalize lipid imbalance or oxidative stress. Protein array analysis revealed differential expression and shedding of cytokines and growth factors from CF epithelial cells compared to non-CF cells, consistent with sterile inflammation and tissue remodeling under basal conditions, including enhanced secretion of the neutrophil activator CXCL5, and the T-cell activator CCL17. However, treatment with antioxidants or CFTR modulators that mimic the approved combination therapies, ivacaftor/lumacaftor and ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, did not effectively suppress the inflammatory phenotype. We propose that CFTR deficiency causes oxidative stress in CF airway epithelium, affecting multiple bioactive lipid metabolic pathways, which likely play a role in CF lung disease progression. A combination of anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and CFTR targeted therapeutics may be required for full correction of the CF phenotype.",33613309,PMC7891400,10.3389/fphys.2021.619442,,2021,"Veltman M, De Sanctis JB, Stolarczyk M, Klymiuk N, Bähr A, Brouwer RW, Oole E, Shah J, Ozdian T, Liao J, Martini C, Radzioch D, Hanrahan JW, Scholte BJ.",Y,MED
Current and Emerging Therapies to Combat Cystic Fibrosis Lung Infections.,"The ultimate aim of any antimicrobial treatment is a better infection outcome for the patient. Here, we review the current state of treatment for bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung while also investigating potential new treatments being developed to see how they may change the dynamics of antimicrobial therapy. Treatment with antibiotics coupled with regular physical therapy has been shown to reduce exacerbations and may eradicate some strains. Therapies such as hypertonic saline and inhaled PulmozymeTM (DNase-I) improve mucus clearance, while modifier drugs, singly and more successfully in combination, re-open certain mutant forms of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to enable ion passage. No current method, however, completely eradicates infection, mainly due to bacterial survival within biofilm aggregates. Lung transplants increase lifespan, but reinfection is a continuing problem. CFTR modifiers normalise ion transport for the affected mutations, but there is conflicting evidence on bacterial clearance. Emerging treatments combine antibiotics with novel compounds including quorum-sensing inhibitors, antioxidants, and enzymes, or with bacteriophages, aiming to disrupt the biofilm matrix and improve antibiotic access. Other treatments involve bacteriophages that target, infect and kill bacteria. These novel therapeutic approaches are showing good promise in vitro, and a few have made the leap to in vivo testing.",34576767,PMC8466233,10.3390/microorganisms9091874,,2021,Manos J.,Y,MED
The Equitable Implementation of Cystic Fibrosis Personalized Medicines in Canada.,"This article identifies the potential sources of inequity in three stages of integrating cystic fibrosis personalized medicines into the Canadian healthcare system and proposes mitigating strategies: (1) clinical research and diagnostic testing; (2) regulatory oversight and market authorization; and (3) implementation into the healthcare system. There is concern that differential access will cast a dark shadow over personalized medicine by stratifying the care that groups of patients will receive-not only based on their genetic profiles, but also on the basis of their socioeconomic status. Furthermore, there is a need to re-evaluate regulatory and market approval mechanisms to accommodate the unique nature of personalized medicines. Physical and financial accessibility ought to be remedied before personalized medicines can be equitably delivered to patients. This article identifies the socio-ethical and legal challenges at each stage and recommends mitigating policy solutions.",34067090,PMC8151662,10.3390/jpm11050382,,2021,"Shemie G, Nguyen MT, Wallenburg J, Ratjen F, Knoppers BM.",Y,MED
New strategies of physical activity assessment in cystic fibrosis: a pilot study.,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a valued part of cystic fibrosis (CF) care. Although the accelerometer, SenseWear Armband (SWA), accurately measures habitual PA in CF, it is mostly used for research purposes. For the first time, we analyzed different methods of measuring PA in daily life by the use of smartphones and other electronic devices such as smartwatch and Fitbit.Methods: Twenty-four stable adults with CF (mean age 37.5 ± 11.5SD yrs.; FEV1 58 ± 19% predicted, BMI 22.9 ± 3.2) were studied. Daily PA was monitored for seven consecutive days. All patients wore the accelerometer SWA and at the same time they monitored PA with the electronic device they used routinely. They were allocated into one of four arms according to their device: Smartwatch, Fitbit, Android smartphones and iOS smartphones. PA related measurements included: duration of PA, energy expenditure, number of steps.Results: There was a good agreement between SWA and Fitbit for number of steps (p = 0.605) and energy expenditure (p = 0.143). iOS smartphones were similar to SWA in monitoring the number of steps (p = 0.911). Significant differences were found between SWA and both Smartwatch and Android smartphones.Conclusions: Fitbit and iOS smartphones seem to be a valuable approach to monitor daily PA. They provide a good performance to measure step number compared to SWA.",33126875,PMC7599110,10.1186/s12890-020-01313-5,,2020,"Savi D, Graziano L, Giordani B, Schiavetto S, Vito C, Migliara G, Simmonds NJ, Palange P, Elborn JS.",Y,MED

The estimation of health state utility values in rare diseases: do the approaches in submissions for NICE technology appraisals reflect the existing literature? A scoping review.,"Background: Rare diseases negatively impact patients' quality of life, but the estimation of health state utility values (HSUVs) in research studies and cost-utility models for health technology assessment is challenging.Objectives: This study compared the methods for estimating the HSUVs included in manufacturers' submissions of orphan drugs to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) with those of published studies addressing the same rare diseases to understand whether manufacturers fully exploited the existing literature in developing their economic models.Methods: All NICE Technology Appraisal (TA) and Highly Specialized Technologies (HST) guidance documents of non-cancer European Medicines Agency (EMA) orphan medicinal products were reviewed and compared with any published primary studies, retrieved via PubMed until November 2020, and estimating HSUVs for the same conditions addressed in manufacturers' submissions.Results: We identified 22 NICE TA/HST appraisal reports addressing 19 different rare diseases. Sixteen reports presented original HSUVs estimated using EQ-5D or Health Utility Index (n = 12), direct methods (n = 2) or mapping (n = 2), while the other six included values obtained from the literature only. In parallel, we identified 111 published studies: 86.6% used preference-based measures (mainly EQ-5D, 60.7%), 12.5% direct techniques, and 2.7% mapping. The collection of values from non-patient populations (using 'vignettes') was more frequent in manufacturers' submissions than in the literature (22.7% vs. 8.0%).Conclusions: The agreement on methodological choices between manufacturers' submissions and published literature was only partial. More efforts should be made by manufacturers to accurately reflect the academic literature and its methodological recommendations in orphan drugs submissions.",36335234,PMC10406664,10.1007/s10198-022-01541-y,,2023,"Meregaglia M, Nicod E, Drummond M.",Y,MED
Cytochrome P450 3A4 Induction: Lumacaftor versus Ivacaftor Potentially Resulting in Significantly Reduced Plasma Concentration of Ivacaftor.,"Background & objective: Since the release of ivacaftor-lumacaftor, several red-flags have been raised that highlight the clinical efficacy of this combination strategy that may be limited due to antagonistic drug-drug interactions.Method: The effect of ivacaftor, its major metabolites M1 and M6, lumacaftor and the novel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator tezacaftor at 10 µg/mL on the enzymatic activity of the major xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 as well as the minor enzymes CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 was assayed.Results: Lumacaftor (3.74 x 105 ± 3.11 x 104 RLU), and ivacaftor-M6 (3.43 x 105 ± 7.61 x 103 RLU) markedly induced the activity of CYP3A4. Ivacaftor (2.22 x 105 ± 3.94 x 104 RLU) showed a lower relative ratio of luminescence units compared to chloramphenicol (3.17 x 105 ± 1.55 x 104 RLU). Interestingly, ivacaftor-M1 (6.74 x 104 ± 3.09 x 104 RLU) and the novel CFTR modulator tezacaftor (2.40 x 104 ± 8.14 x 104 RLU) did not show CYP3A4 induction. In the CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 assay, all metabolites showed a decrease in the ratio of luminescence units compared to the controls. Ivacaftor, its major metabolites, lumacaftor and tezacaftor all showed a slight increase in the ratio of luminescence units compared to the control rifampin with CYP2B6.Conclusion: All in all, present findings would suggest that lumacaftor and ivacaftor-M6 are strong inducers of CYP3A4, potentially reducing ivacaftor concentrations; ivacaftor itself induces CYP3A4 to some extent.",29595119,PMC6350194,10.2174/1872312812666180328105259,,2018,Schneider EK.,Y,MED
Comprehensive Analysis of Chemical Structures That Have Been Tested as CFTR Activating Substances in a Publicly Available Database CandActCFTR.,"**Background:** Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in *CFTR*, which encodes a chloride and bicarbonate transporter expressed in exocrine epithelia throughout the body. Recently, some therapeutics became available that directly target dysfunctional CFTR, yet research for more effective substances is ongoing. The database CandActCFTR aims to provide detailed and comprehensive information on candidate therapeutics for the activation of CFTR-mediated ion conductance aiding systems-biology approaches to identify substances that will synergistically activate CFTR-mediated ion conductance based on published data. **Results:** Until 10/2020, we derived data from 108 publications on 3,109 CFTR-relevant substances via the literature database PubMed and further 666 substances via ChEMBL; only 19 substances were shared between these sources. One hundred and forty-five molecules do not have a corresponding entry in PubChem or ChemSpider, which indicates that there currently is no single comprehensive database on chemical substances in the public domain. Apart from basic data on all compounds, we have visualized the chemical space derived from their chemical descriptors via a principal component analysis annotated for CFTR-relevant biological categories. Our online query tools enable the search for most similar compounds and provide the relevant annotations in a structured way. The integration of the KNIME software environment in the back-end facilitates a fast and user-friendly maintenance of the provided data sets and a quick extension with new functionalities, e.g., new analysis routines. CandActBase automatically integrates information from other online sources, such as synonyms from PubChem and provides links to other resources like ChEMBL or the source publications. **Conclusion:** CandActCFTR aims to establish a database model of candidate cystic fibrosis therapeutics for the activation of CFTR-mediated ion conductance to merge data from publicly available sources. Using CandActBase, our strategy to represent data from several internet resources in a merged and organized form can also be applied to other use cases. For substances tested as CFTR activating compounds, the search function allows users to check if a specific compound or a closely related substance was already tested in the CF field. The acquired information on tested substances will assist in the identification of the most promising candidates for future therapeutics.",34955819,PMC8692862,10.3389/fphar.2021.689205,,2021,"Nietert MM, Vinhoven L, Auer F, Hafkemeyer S, Stanke F.",Y,MED
Unravelling the Regions of Mutant F508del-CFTR More Susceptible to the Action of Four Cystic Fibrosis Correctors.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease associated with the defective function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein that causes obstructive disease and chronic bacterial infections in airway epithelia. The most prevalent CF-causing mutation, the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del), leads to CFTR misfolding, trafficking defects and premature degradation. A number of correctors that are able to partially rescue F508del-CFTR processing defects have been identified. Clinical trials have demonstrated that, unfortunately, mono-therapy with the best correctors identified to date does not ameliorate lung function or sweat chloride concentration in homozygous F508del patients. Understanding the mechanisms exerted by currently available correctors to increase mutant F508del-CFTR expression is essential for the development of new CF-therapeutics. We investigated the activity of correctors on the mutant F508del and wild type (WT) CFTR to identify the protein domains whose expression is mostly affected by the action of correctors, and we investigated their mechanisms of action. We found that the four correctors under study, lumacaftor (VX809), the quinazoline derivative VX325, the bithiazole compound corr4a, and the new molecule tezacaftor (VX661), do not influence either the total expression or the maturation of the WT-CFTR transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. Contrarily, they significantly enhance the expression and the maturation of the full length F508del molecule. Three out of four correctors, VX809, VX661 and VX325, seem to specifically improve the expression and the maturation of the mutant CFTR N-half (M1N1, residues 1-633). By contrast, the CFTR C-half (M2N2, residues 837-1480) appears to be the region mainly affected by corr4a. VX809 was shown to stabilize both the WT- and F508del-CFTR N-half isoforms, while VX661 and VX325 demonstrated the ability to enhance the stability only of the mutant F508del polypeptide.",31683989,PMC6862496,10.3390/ijms20215463,,2019,"Amico G, Brandas C, Moran O, Baroni D.",Y,MED
Dysfunction in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease as a Potential Target for Personalised Medicine.,"In recent years, numerous pathways were explored in the pathogenesis of COPD in the quest for new potential therapeutic targets for more personalised medical care. In this context, the study of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) began to gain importance, especially since the advent of the new CFTR modulators which had the potential to correct this protein's dysfunction in COPD. The CFTR is an ion transporter that regulates the hydration and viscosity of mucous secretions in the airway. Therefore, its abnormal function favours the accumulation of thicker and more viscous secretions, reduces the periciliary layer and mucociliary clearance, and produces inflammation in the airway, as a consequence of a bronchial infection by both bacteria and viruses. Identifying CFTR dysfunction in the context of COPD pathogenesis is key to fully understanding its role in the complex pathophysiology of COPD and the potential of the different therapeutic approaches proposed to overcome this dysfunction. In particular, the potential of the rehydration of mucus and the role of antioxidants and phosphodiesterase inhibitors should be discussed. Additionally, the modulatory drugs which enhance or restore decreased levels of the protein CFTR were recently described. In particular, two CFTR potentiators, ivacaftor and icenticaftor, were explored in COPD. The present review updated the pathophysiology of the complex role of CFTR in COPD and the therapeutic options which could be explored.",34680554,PMC8533244,10.3390/biomedicines9101437,,2021,"Carrasco-Hernández L, Quintana-Gallego E, Calero C, Reinoso-Arija R, Ruiz-Duque B, López-Campos JL.",Y,MED
Variable Responses to CFTR Correctors *in vitro*: Estimating the Design Effect in Precision Medicine.,"Interest in precision medicine has grown in recent years due to the variable clinical benefit provided by some medications, their cost, and by new opportunities to tailor therapies to individual patients. In cystic fibrosis it may soon be possible to test several corrector drugs that improve the folding and functional expression of mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) prospectively using cells from a patient to find the one that is best for that individual. Patient-to-patient variation in cell culture responses to correctors and the reproducibility of those responses has not been studied quantitatively. We measured the functional correction provided by lumacaftor (VX-809) using bronchial epithelial cells from 20 patients homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Significant differences were observed between individuals, supporting the utility of prospective testing. However, when correction of F508del-CFTR was measured repeatedly using cell aliquots from the same individuals, a design effect was observed that would impact statistical tests of significance. The results suggest that the sample size obtained from power calculations should be increased to compensate for group sampling when CFTR corrector drugs are compared *in vitro* for precision medicine.",30618775,PMC6305743,10.3389/fphar.2018.01490,,2018,"Matthes E, Goepp J, Martini C, Shan J, Liao J, Thomas DY, Hanrahan JW.",Y,MED
"Assays of CFTR Function In Vitro, Ex Vivo and In Vivo.","Cystic fibrosis, a multi-organ genetic disease, is characterized by abnormal function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a chloride channel at the apical membrane of several epithelia. In recent years, therapeutic strategies have been developed to correct the CFTR defect. To evaluate CFTR function at baseline for diagnosis, or the efficacy of CFTR-restoring therapy, reliable tests are needed to measure CFTR function, in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. In vitro techniques either directly or indirectly measure ion fluxes; direct measurement of ion fluxes and quenching of fluorescence in cell-based assays, change in transmembrane voltage or current in patch clamp or Ussing chamber, swelling of CFTR-containing organoids by secondary water influx upon CFTR activation. Several cell or tissue types can be used. Ex vivo and in vivo assays similarly evaluate current (intestinal current measurement) and membrane potential differences (nasal potential difference), on tissues from individual patients. In the sweat test, the most frequently used in vivo evaluation of CFTR function, chloride concentration or stimulated sweat rate can be directly measured. Here, we will describe the currently available bio-assays for quantitative evaluation of CFTR function, their indications, advantages and disadvantages, and correlation with clinical outcome measures.",35163362,PMC8836180,10.3390/ijms23031437,,2022,"Ramalho AS, Boon M, Proesmans M, Vermeulen F, Carlon MS, Boeck K.",Y,MED
Rapid therapeutic advances in CFTR modulator science.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by variants in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conduction regulator (CFTR) protein. Loss of CFTR function disrupts chloride, bicarbonate and regulation of sodium transport, producing a cascade of mucus obstruction, inflammation, pulmonary infection, and ultimately damage in numerous organs. Established CF therapies treat the downstream consequences of CFTR dysfunction and have led to steady improvements in patient survival. A class of drugs termed CFTR modulators has recently entered the CF therapeutic landscape. These drugs differ fundamentally from prior therapies in that they aim to improve the function of disease-causing CFTR variants. This review summarizes the science behind CFTR modulators, including their targets, mechanism of action, clinical benefit, and future directions in the field. CFTR modulators have dramatically changed how CF is treated, validated CFTR as a therapeutic target, and opened the door to truly personalized therapies and treatment regimens.",30289627,PMC6585954,10.1002/ppul.24157,,2018,Clancy JP.,Y,MED

HDAC6 also plays a crucial role in bacterial clearance or killing as a direct consequence of its effects on CF immune responses. Inhibiting HDAC6 functions thus eventually represents an innovative and effective strategy to tackle multiple aspects of CF-associated lung disease.

Integrative chemogenomic analysis identifies small molecules that partially rescue ΔF508-CFTR for cystic fibrosis.,"Rare diseases affect 10% of the first-world population, yet over 95% lack even a single pharmaceutical treatment. In the present age of information, we need ways to leverage our vast data and knowledge to streamline therapeutic development and lessen this gap. Here, we develop and implement an innovative informatic approach to identify therapeutic molecules, using the Connectivity Map and LINCS L1000 databases and disease-associated transcriptional signatures and pathways. We apply this to cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common genetic disease in people of northern European ancestry leading to chronic lung disease and reduced lifespan. We selected and tested 120 small molecules in a CF cell line, finding 8 with activity, and confirmed 3 in primary CF airway epithelia. Although chemically diverse, the transcriptional profiles of the hits suggest a common mechanism associated with the unfolded protein response and/or TNFα signaling.

Rescue of multiple class II CFTR mutations by elexacaftor+tezacaftor+ivacaftor mediated in part by the dual activities of elexacaftor as both corrector and potentiator.,"Positive results in pre-clinical studies of the triple combination of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, performed in airway epithelial cell cultures obtained from patients harbouring the class II cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation F508del-CFTR, translated to impressive clinical outcomes for subjects carrying this mutation in clinical trials and approval of Trikafta.Encouraged by this correlation, we were prompted to evaluate the effect of the elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor triple combination on primary nasal epithelial cultures obtained from individuals with rare class II CF-causing mutations (G85E, M1101K and N1303K) for which Trikafta is not approved.Cultures from individuals homozygous for M1101K responded better than cultures harbouring G85E and N1303K after treatment with the triple combination with respect to improvement in regulated channel function and protein processing. A similar genotype-specific effect of the triple combination was observed when the different mutations were expressed in HEK293 cells, supporting the hypothesis that these modulators may act directly on the mutant proteins. Detailed studies in nasal cultures and HEK293 cells showed that the corrector, elexacaftor, exhibited dual activity as both corrector and potentiator, and suggested that the potentiator activity contributes to its pharmacological activity.These pre-clinical studies using nasal epithelial cultures identified mutation genotypes for which elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor may produce clinical responses that are comparable to, or inferior to, those observed for F508del-CFTR.",33303536,PMC8209484,10.1183/13993003.02774-2020,,2021,"Laselva O, Bartlett C, Gunawardena TNA, Ouyang H, Eckford PDW, Moraes TJ, Bear CE, Gonska T.",Y,MED
"The Changing Epidemiology of Cystic Fibrosis: Incidence, Survival and Impact of the *CFTR* Gene Discovery.","Significant advances in the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) in recentdecades have dramatically changed the epidemiology and prognosis of this serious disease, which is no longer an exclusively pediatric disease. This paper aims to review the changes in the incidence and survival of CF and to assess the impact of the discovery of the responsible gene (the *CFTR* gene) on these changes. The incidence of CF appears to be decreasing in most countries andpatient survival, which can be monitored by various indicators, has improved substantially, with an *estimated median age of survival*of approximately50 years today. Cloning of the *CFTR* gene 30 years ago and efforts to identify its many mutations have greatly improved the management of CF. Implementation of genetic screening policies hasenabled earlier diagnosis (via newborn screening), in addition to prevention within families or in the general population in some areas (via prenatal diagnosis, family testing or population carrier screening). In the past decade, in-depth knowledge of the molecular bases of CF has also enabled the emergenceof CFTR modulator therapies which have led to major clinical advances in the treatment of CF. All of these phenomena have contributed to changing the face of CF. The advent of targeted therapies has paved the way for precision medicine and is expected to further improve survival in the coming years.",32466381,PMC7348877,10.3390/genes11060589,,2020,"Scotet V, L'Hostis C, Férec C.",Y,MED
Plasma microRNA levels in male and female children with cystic fibrosis.,"A gender gap exists in cystic fibrosis (CF).

Increased extracellular vesicles mediate inflammatory signalling in cystic fibrosis.,"Rationale: Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (*CFTR*) gene form the basis of cystic fibrosis (CF). There remains an important knowledge gap in CF as to how diminished CFTR activity leads to the dominant inflammatory response within CF airways.Objectives: To investigate if extracellular vesicles (EVs) contribute to inflammatory signalling in CF.Methods: EVs released from CFBE41o-, CuFi-5, 16HBE14o- and NuLi-1 cells were characterised by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). EVs isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 30 people with CF (PWCF) were analysed by NTA and mass spectrometry and compared with controls. Neutrophils were isolated from the blood of 8 PWCF to examine neutrophil migration in the presence of CFBE41o- EVs.Results: A significantly higher level of EVs were released from CFBE41o- (p<0.0001) and CuFi-5 (p=0.0209) relative to control cell lines. A significantly higher level of EVs were detected in BALF of PWCF, in three different age groups relative to controls (p=0.01, 0.001, 0.002). A significantly lower level of EVs were released from CFBE41o- (p<0.001) and CuFi-5 (p=0.0002) cell lines treated with CFTR modulators. Significant changes in the protein expression of 126 unique proteins was determined in EVs obtained from the BALF of PWCF of different age groups (p<0.001-0.05). A significant increase in chemotaxis of neutrophils derived from PWCF was observed in the presence of CFBE41o EVs (p=0.0024) compared with controls.Conclusion: This study demonstrates that EVs are produced in CF airway cells, have differential protein expression at different ages and drive neutrophil recruitment in CF.",32265339,PMC7279202,10.1136/thoraxjnl-2019-214027,,2020,"Useckaite Z, Ward MP, Trappe A, Reilly R, Lennon J, Davage H, Matallanas D, Cassidy H, Dillon ET, Brennan K, Doyle SL, Carter S, Donnelly S, Linnane B, McKone EF, McNally P, Coppinger JA.",Y,MED
"Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation Considerations for Women with CF in the CFTR Modulator Era.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder impacting approximately 80,000 people of all races and ethnicities world-wide. CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene which encodes a protein of the same name. Protein dysfunction results in abnormal chloride and bicarbonate transport in mucus membranes, including those in the respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts. Abnormal anion transport causes viscous secretions at the site of involvement. The majority of people with CF succumb to respiratory failure following recurrent cycles of infection and inflammation in the airways. Historically, providers treated the signs and symptoms of CF, but since 2012, have been able to impact the basic defect for the subset of people with CF who have mutations that respond to the new class of drugs, CFTR protein modulators. With the improved health and longevity afforded by CFTR modulators, more women are interested in parenthood and are becoming pregnant. Furthermore, this class of drugs likely increases fertility in women with CF. However, the safety of CFTR modulators in pregnancy and lactation is only beginning to be established. We summarize available data on the impact of CFTR modulators on fertility, pregnancy and lactation in women with CF.",34063507,PMC8156060,10.3390/jpm11050418,,2021,"Jain R, Taylor-Cousar JL.",Y,MED
Immunomodulation in Cystic Fibrosis: Why and How?,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by unconventional mechanisms of inflammation, implicating a chronic immune response dominated by innate immune cells. Historically, therapeutic development has focused on the mutated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), leading to the discovery of small molecules aiming at modulating and potentiating the presence and activity of CFTR at the plasma membrane. However, treatment burden sustained by CF patients, side effects of current medications, and recent advances in other therapeutic areas have highlighted the need to develop novel disease targeting of the inflammatory component driving CF lung damage. Furthermore, current issues with standard treatment emphasize the need for directed lung therapies that could minimize systemic side effects. Here, we summarize current treatment used to target immune cells in the lungs, and highlight potential benefits and caveats of novel therapeutic strategies.",32397175,PMC7247557,10.3390/ijms21093331,,2020,"Giacalone VD, Dobosh BS, Gaggar A, Tirouvanziam R, Margaroli C.",Y,MED
Sex disparities in cystic fibrosis: review on the effect of female sex hormones on lung pathophysiology and outcomes.,"Sex differences in morbidity and mortality have been reported in the cystic fibrosis (CF) population worldwide. However, it is unclear why CF women have worse clinical outcomes than men. In this review, we focus on the influence of female sex hormones on CF pulmonary outcomes and summarise data from *in vitro* and *in vivo* experiments on how oestrogen and progesterone might modify mucociliary clearance, immunity and infection in the CF airways. The potential for novel sex hormone-related therapeutic interventions is also discussed.",33532475,PMC7836644,10.1183/23120541.00475-2020,,2021,"Lam GY, Goodwin J, Wilcox PG, Quon BS.",Y,MED
CFTR Modulators Restore Acidification of Autophago-Lysosomes and Bacterial Clearance in Cystic Fibrosis Macrophages.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) human and mouse macrophages are defective in their ability to clear bacteria such as *Burkholderia cenocepacia*. The autophagy process in CF (F508del) macrophages is halted, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Furthermore, the role of CFTR in maintaining the acidification of endosomal and lysosomal compartments in CF cells has been a subject of debate. Using 3D reconstruction of z-stack confocal images, we show that CFTR is recruited to LC3-labeled autophagosomes harboring *B. cenocepacia.* Using several complementary approaches, we report that CF macrophages display defective lysosomal acidification and degradative function for cargos destined to autophagosomes, whereas non-autophagosomal cargos are effectively degraded within acidic compartments. Notably, treatment of CF macrophages with CFTR modulators (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) improved the autophagy flux, lysosomal acidification and function, and bacterial clearance. In addition, CFTR modulators improved CFTR function as demonstrated by patch-clamp. In conclusion, CFTR regulates the acidification of a specific subset of lysosomes that specifically fuse with autophagosomes. Therefore, our study describes a new biological location and function for CFTR in autophago-lysosomes and clarifies the long-standing discrepancies in the field.",35252032,PMC8890004,10.3389/fcimb.2022.819554,,2022,"Badr A, Eltobgy M, Krause K, Hamilton K, Estfanous S, Daily KP, Abu Khweek A, Hegazi A, Anne MNK, Carafice C, Robledo-Avila F, Saqr Y, Zhang X, Bonfield TL, Gavrilin MA, Partida-Sanchez S, Seveau S, Cormet-Boyaka E, Amer AO.",Y,MED
Factors for severe outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with cystic fibrosis in Europe.,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) can lead to severe outcomes.Methods: In this observational study, the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry collected data on pwCF and SARS-CoV-2 infection to estimate incidence, describe clinical presentation and investigate factors associated with severe outcomes using multivariable analysis.Results: Up to December 31, 2020, 26 countries reported information on 828 pwCF and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Incidence was 17.2 per 1000 pwCF (95% CI: 16.0-18.4). Median age was 24 years, 48.4% were male and 9.4% had lung transplants. SARS-CoV-2 incidence was higher in lung-transplanted (28.6; 95% CI: 22.7-35.5) *versus* non-lung-transplanted pwCF (16.6; 95% CI: 15.4-17.8) (p≤0.001).SARS-CoV-2 infection caused symptomatic illness in 75.7%. Factors associated with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were age >40 years, at least one F508del mutation and pancreatic insufficiency.Overall, 23.7% of pwCF were admitted to hospital, 2.5% of those to intensive care, and regretfully 11 (1.4%) died. Hospitalisation, oxygen therapy, intensive care, respiratory support and death were 2- to 6-fold more frequent in lung-transplanted *versus* non-lung-transplanted pwCF.Factors associated with hospitalisation and oxygen therapy were lung transplantation, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD), moderate or severe lung disease and azithromycin use (often considered a surrogate marker for *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infection and poorer lung function).Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 infection yielded high morbidity and hospitalisation in pwCF.

First Wave of COVID-19 in French Patients with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Viral infections are known to lead to serious respiratory complications in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Hypothesizing that CF patients were a population at high risk for severe respiratory complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a national study to describe the clinical expression of COVID-19 in French CF patients. This prospective observational study involves all 47 French CF centers caring for approximately 7500 CF patients. Between March 1st and June 30th 2020, 31 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19: 19 had positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs; 1 had negative RT-PCR but typical COVID-19 signs on a CT scan; and 11 had positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. Fifteen were males, median (range) age was 31 (9-60) years, and 12 patients were living with a lung transplant. The majority of the patients had CF-related diabetes (*n* = 19, 61.3%), and a mild lung disease (*n* = 19, 65%, with percent-predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV1) > 70). Three (10%) patients remained asymptomatic. For the 28 (90%) patients who displayed symptoms, most common symptoms at admission were fever (*n* = 22, 78.6%), fatigue (*n* = 14, 50%), and increased cough (*n* = 14, 50%). Nineteen were hospitalized (including 11 out of the 12 post-lung transplant patients), seven required oxygen therapy, and four (3 post-lung transplant patients) were admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Ten developed complications (including acute respiratory distress syndrome in two post-lung transplant patients), but all recovered and were discharged home without noticeable short-term sequelae. Overall, French CF patients were rarely diagnosed with COVID-19. Further research should establish whether they were not infected or remained asymptomatic upon infection. In diagnosed cases, the short-term evolution was favorable with rare acute respiratory distress syndrome and no death. Post-lung transplant patients had more severe outcomes and should be monitored more closely.",33182847,PMC7697588,10.3390/jcm9113624,,2020,"Corvol H, de Miranda S, Lemonnier L, Kemgang A, Reynaud Gaubert M, Chiron R, Dalphin ML, Durieu I, Dubus JC, Houdouin V, Prevotat A, Ramel S, Revillion M, Weiss L, Guillot L, Boelle PY, Burgel PR.",Y,MED
Different CFTR modulator combinations downregulate inflammation differently in cystic fibrosis.,"Previously, we showed that serum and monocytes from patients with CF exhibit an enhanced NLRP3-inflammasome signature with increased IL-18, IL-1β, caspase-1 activity and ASC speck release (Scambler et al. eLife 2019). Here we show that CFTR modulators down regulate this exaggerated proinflammatory response following LPS/ATP stimulation. In vitro application of ivacaftor/lumacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor to CF monocytes showed a significant reduction in IL-18, whereas IL-1β was only reduced with ivacaftor/tezacaftor. Thirteen adults starting ivacaftor/lumacaftor and eight starting ivacaftor/tezacaftor were assessed over three months. Serum IL-18 and TNF decreased significantly with treatments, but IL-1β only declined following ivacaftor/tezacaftor. In (LPS/ATP-stimulated) PBMCs, IL-18/TNF/caspase-1 were all significantly decreased and IL-10 was increased with both combinations. Ivacaftor/tezacaftor alone showed a significant reduction in IL-1β and pro-IL-1β mRNA. This study demonstrates that these CFTR modulator combinations have potent anti-inflammatory properties, in addition to their ability to stimulate CFTR function, which could contribute to improved clinical outcomes.",32118580,PMC7062465,10.7554/elife.54556,,2020,"Jarosz-Griffiths HH, Scambler T, Wong CH, Lara-Reyna S, Holbrook J, Martinon F, Savic S, Whitaker P, Etherington C, Spoletini G, Clifton I, Mehta A, McDermott MF, Peckham D.",Y,MED
Impact of Cross-Coupling Reactions in Drug Discovery and Development.,"Cross-coupling reactions have played a critical role enabling the rapid expansion of structure-activity relationships (SAR) during the drug discovery phase to identify a clinical candidate and facilitate subsequent drug development processes. The reliability and flexibility of this methodology have attracted great interest in the pharmaceutical industry, becoming one of the most used approaches from Lead Generation to Lead Optimization. In this mini-review, we present an overview of cross-coupling reaction applications to medicinal chemistry efforts, in particular the Suzuki-Miyaura and Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling reactions as a remarkable resource for the generation of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds. To further appreciate the impact of this methodology, the authors discuss some recent examples of clinical candidates that utilize key cross-coupling reactions in their large-scale synthetic process. Looking into future opportunities, the authors highlight the versatility of the cross-coupling reactions towards new chemical modalities like DNA-encoded libraries (DELs), new generation of peptides and cyclopeptides, allosteric modulators, and proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) approaches.",32751973,PMC7436090,10.3390/molecules25153493,,2020,"Buskes MJ, Blanco MJ.",Y,MED
Viral-Bacterial Co-infections in the Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Tract.,"A majority of the morbidity and mortality associated with the genetic disease Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is due to lung disease resulting from chronic respiratory infections. The CF airways become chronically colonized with bacteria in childhood, and over time commensal lung microbes are displaced by bacterial pathogens, leading to a decrease in microbial diversity that correlates with declining patient health. Infection with the pathogen *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is a major predictor of morbidity and mortality in CF, with CF individuals often becoming chronically colonized with *P. aeruginosa* in early adulthood and thereafter having an increased risk of hospitalization. Progression of CF respiratory disease is also influenced by infection with respiratory viruses. Children and adults with CF experience frequent respiratory viral infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovirus, with RSV and influenza infection linked to the greatest decreases in lung function. Along with directly causing severe respiratory symptoms in CF populations, the impact of respiratory virus infections may be more far-reaching, indirectly promoting bacterial persistence and pathogenesis in the CF respiratory tract. Acquisition of *P. aeruginosa* in CF patients correlates with seasonal respiratory virus infections, and CF patients colonized with *P. aeruginosa* experience increased severe exacerbations and declines in lung function during respiratory viral co-infection. In light of such observations, efforts to better understand the impact of viral-bacterial co-infections in the CF airways have been a focus of clinical and basic research in recent years. This review summarizes what has been learned about the interactions between viruses and bacteria in the CF upper and lower respiratory tract and how co-infections impact the health of individuals with CF.",30619379,PMC6306490,10.3389/fimmu.2018.03067,,2018,"Kiedrowski MR, Bomberger JM.",Y,MED
Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators have differential effects on cystic fibrosis macrophage function.,"Despite the addition of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators to the cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment regimen, patients with CF continue to suffer from chronic bacterial infections that lead to progressive respiratory morbidity. Host immunity, and macrophage dysfunction specifically, has an integral role in the inability of patients with CF to clear bacterial infections. We sought to characterize macrophage responses to CFTR modulator treatment as we hypothesized that there would be differential effects based on patient genotype. Human CF and non-CF peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were analyzed for CFTR expression, apoptosis, polarization, phagocytosis, bacterial killing, and cytokine production via microscopy, flow cytometry, and ELISA-based assays. Compared to non-CF MDMs, CF MDMs display decreased CFTR expression, increased apoptosis, and decreased phagocytosis. CFTR expression increased and apoptosis decreased in response to ivacaftor or lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy, and phagocytosis improved with ivacaftor alone. Ivacaftor restored CF macrophage polarization responses to non-CF levels and reduced Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial burden, but did not reduce other bacterial loads. Macrophage inflammatory cytokine production decreased in response to ivacaftor alone. In summary, ivacaftor and lumacaftor/ivacaftor have differential impacts on macrophage function with minimal changes observed in CF patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Overall improvements in macrophage function in ivacaftor-treated CF patients result in modestly improved macrophage-mediated bacterial killing.",30459435,PMC6244248,10.1038/s41598-018-35151-7,,2018,"Zhang S, Shrestha CL, Kopp BT.",Y,MED
Vardenafil increases intracellular accumulation of the most prevalent mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CTFR) in human bronchial epithelial cells.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease characterized by progressive lung and chronic digestive manifestations. We have shown that therapeutic doses of vardenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, corrects CF Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR)-dependent chloride transport in respiratory and intestinal tissues of F508del homozygous mice. Here, we studied the effect of vardenafil on CFTR in 16HBE14o- and CFBE41o- cell lines. First, the expression levels of PDE5 mRNA in these cell lines were monitored. The two cell lines were exposed to different drugs (dimethyl sulfoxide, 8-Br-cGMP, forskolin or vardenafil). The cAMP and cGMP intracellular concentrations were measured. Finally, we localised the CFTR by immunolabelling. PDE5 was similarly expressed in both wild-type and in CF cells. A fast and transient rise in cGMP intracellular contents followed treatment with vardenafil, confirming its PDE5 inhibitory effect. We showed that vardenafil promoted both the early steps of the cellular processing and the trafficking of F508del without fully addressing the protein to the plasma membrane. The effect was not reproduced by the brominated cGMP analogue and it was not prevented by the combination of a protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor and vardenafil. These findings support the view that vardenafil partially rescues F508del through cGMP/PKG-independent mechanisms.",32747447,PMC7473651,10.1242/bio.053116,,2020,"Dhooghe B, Bouzin C, Mottais A, Hermans E, Delion M, Panin N, Noel S, Leal T.",Y,MED

Treatment of lung diseases *via* nanoparticles and nanorobots: Are these viable alternatives to overcome current treatments?,"Challenges: Respiratory diseases remain challenging to treat, with current efforts primarily focused on managing symptoms rather than maintaining overall lung health. Traditional treatment methods, such as oral or parenteral administration of antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory drugs, face limitations. These include difficulty in delivering therapeutic agents to pathogens residing deep in the airways and the risk of severe side effects due to high systemic drug concentrations. The growing threat of drug-resistant pathogens further complicates infection management.Advancements: The lung's large surface area offers an attractive target for inhalation-based drug delivery. Nanoparticles (NP) enable uniform and sustained drug distribution across the alveolar network, overcoming challenges posed by complex lung anatomy. Recent breakthroughs in nanorobots (NR) have demonstrated precise navigation through biological environments, delivering therapies directly to affected lung areas with enhanced accuracy. Nanotechnology has also shown promise in treating lung cancer, with nanoparticles engineered to overcome biological barriers, improve drug solubility, and enable controlled drug release.Future scope: This review explores the progress of NP and NR in addressing challenges in pulmonary drug delivery.

Identification of Potential Leukocyte Biomarkers Related to Drug Recovery of CFTR: Clinical Applications in Cystic Fibrosis.,"The aim of this study was the identification of specific proteomic profiles, related to a restored cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) activity in cystic fibrosis (CF) leukocytes before and after ex vivo treatment with the potentiator VX770. We used leukocytes, isolated from CF patients carrying residual function mutations and eligible for Ivacaftor therapy, and performed CFTR activity together with proteomic analyses through micro-LC-MS. Bioinformatic analyses of the results obtained revealed the downregulation of proteins belonging to the leukocyte transendothelial migration and regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathways when CFTR activity was rescued by VX770 treatment. In particular, we focused our attention on matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), because the high expression of this protease potentially contributes to parenchyma lung destruction and dysfunction in CF. Thus, the downregulation of MMP9 could represent one of the possible positive effects of VX770 in decreasing the disease progression, and a potential biomarker for the prediction of the efficacy of therapies targeting the defect of Cl- transport in CF.",33920274,PMC8068931,10.3390/ijms22083928,,2021,"Pedrazzi M, Vercellone S, Barberis E, Capraro M, De Tullio R, Cresta F, Casciaro R, Castellani C, Patrone M, Marengo E, Lecca P, Melotti P, Sorio C, Manfredi M, Averna M.",Y,MED

Cystic Fibrosis: Overview of the Current Development Trends and Innovative Therapeutic Strategies.,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive genetic disease, is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This mutation reduces the release of chloride ions (Cl-) in epithelial tissues, and hyperactivates the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) which aid in the absorption of sodium ions (Na+). Consequently, the mucus becomes dehydrated and thickened, making it a suitable medium for microbial growth. CF causes several chronic lung complications like thickened mucus, bacterial infection and inflammation, progressive loss of lung function, and ultimately, death. Until recently, the standard of clinical care in CF treatment had focused on preventing and treating the disease complications. In this review, we have summarized the current knowledge on CF pathogenesis and provided an outlook on the current therapeutic approaches relevant to CF (i.e., CFTR modulators and ENaC inhibitors). The enormous potential in targeting bacterial biofilms using antibiofilm peptides, and the innovative therapeutic strategies in using the CRISPR/Cas approach as a gene-editing tool to repair the CFTR mutation have been reviewed. Finally, we have discussed the wide range of drug delivery systems available, particularly non-viral vectors, and the optimal properties of nanocarriers which are essential for successful drug delivery to the lungs.",32630625,PMC7407299,10.3390/pharmaceutics12070616,,2020,"Almughem FA, Aldossary AM, Tawfik EA, Alomary MN, Alharbi WS, Alshahrani MY, Alshahrani MY, Alshehri AA.",Y,MED

Drug-induced dyspnea versus cystic fibrosis exacerbation: a diagnostic dilemma.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease caused by a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein in the epithelial membrane, and affects at least 30,000 people in the USA. There are between 900 and 1000 new cases diagnosed every year. Traditionally, CF has been treated symptomatically with pancreatic enzymes, bronchodilators, hypertonic saline, and pulmozyme. In July 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor), a combination drug that works on reversing the effects of the defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein. Orkambi and mucolytics decrease the viscosity of mucous secretions, leading to an accumulation of hypoviscous fluid in the alveoli, resulting in dyspnea. This presentation can be mistaken for an infective exacerbation. We present a case in which a young female with CF recently started on Orkambi therapy presented to her primary care physician with dyspnea and increased respiratory secretions and was admitted to the hospital for 2 weeks of intravenous and inhaled antibiotic therapy for a presumed CF exacerbation. We highlight this case to bring awareness and educate patients and clinicians of the side-effect profile of Orkambi therapy with an intent to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations, inpatient antibiotics, and other costly medical services.",28769592,PMC5529089,10.2147/imcrj.s139022,,2017,"Walayat S, Hussain N, Patel J, Hussain F, Patel P, Dhillon S, Aulakh B, Chittivelu S.",Y,MED
Nasal Epithelial Cell-Based Models for Individualized Study in Cystic Fibrosis.,"The emergence of highly effective CFTR modulator therapy has led to significant improvements in health care for most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). For some, however, these therapies remain inaccessible due to the rarity of their individual *CFTR* variants, or due to a lack of biologic activity of the available therapies for certain variants. One proposed method of addressing this gap is the use of primary human cell-based models, which allow preclinical therapeutic testing and physiologic assessment of relevant tissue at the individual level. Nasal cells represent one such tissue source and have emerged as a powerful model for individual disease study. The ex vivo culture of nasal cells has evolved over time, and modern nasal cell models are beginning to be utilized to predict patient outcomes. This review will discuss both historical and current state-of-the art use of nasal cells for study in CF, with a particular focus on the use of such models to inform personalized patient care.",33923202,PMC8123210,10.3390/ijms22094448,,2021,"Keegan DE, Brewington JJ.",Y,MED
Clinical development of triple-combination CFTR modulators for cystic fibrosis patients with one or two *F508del* alleles.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene (*CFTR*) that result in diminished quantity and/or function of the CFTR anion channel. *F508del-CFTR*, the most common CF-causing mutation (found in ∼90% of patients), causes severe processing and trafficking defects, resulting in decreased CFTR quantity and function. CFTR modulators are medications that increase the amount of mature CFTR protein (correctors) or enhance channel function (potentiators) at the cell surface. Combinations of CFTR correctors and potentiators (*i.e.* lumacaftor/ivacaftor, tezacaftor/ivacaftor) have demonstrated clinical benefit in subsets of patients. However, none are approved for patients with CF heterozygous for *F508del*-CFTR and a minimal function mutation, *i.e.* a mutation that produces either no protein or protein that is unresponsive to currently approved CFTR modulators. Next-generation CFTR correctors VX-659 and VX-445, each in triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor, improve CFTR processing, trafficking and function *in vitro* and have demonstrated clinical improvements in phase 2 studies in patients with CF with one or two *F508del*-*CFTR* alleles. Here, we present the rationale and design of four randomised phase 3 studies, and their open-label extensions, evaluating VX-659 (ECLIPSE) or VX-445 (AURORA) plus tezacaftor and ivacaftor in patients with one or two *F508del*-*CFTR* alleles.",31218221,PMC6571452,10.1183/23120541.00082-2019,,2019,"Taylor-Cousar JL, Mall MA, Ramsey BW, McKone EF, Tullis E, Marigowda G, McKee CM, Waltz D, Moskowitz SM, Savage J, Xuan F, Rowe SM.",Y,MED
NBD2 Is Required for the Rescue of Mutant F508del CFTR by a Thiazole-Based Molecule: A Class II Corrector for the Multi-Drug Therapy of Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, an anion channel that regulates epithelial surface fluid secretion. The deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del) is the most common CFTR mutation. F508del CFTR is characterized by folding and trafficking defects, resulting in decreased functional expression of the protein on the plasma membrane. Several classes of small molecules, named correctors, have been developed to rescue defective F508del CFTR. Although individual correctors failed to improve the clinical status of CF patients carrying the F508del mutation, better results were obtained using correctors combinations. These results were obtained according to the premise that the administration of correctors having different sites of action should enhance F508del CFTR rescue. We investigated the putative site of action of an aminoarylthiazole 4-(3-chlorophenyl)-N-(3-(methylthio)phenyl)thiazol-2-amine, named FCG, with proven CFTR corrector activity, and its synergistic effect with the corrector VX809. We found that neither the total expression nor the maturation of WT CFTR transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells was influenced by FCG, administrated alone or in combination with VX809. On the contrary, FCG was able to enhance F508del CFTR total expression, and its combination with VX809 provided a further effect, being able to increase not only the total expression but also the maturation of the mutant protein. Analyses on different CFTR domains and groups of domains, heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells, show that NBD2 is necessary for FCG corrector activity. Molecular modelling analyses suggest that FCG interacts with a putative region located into the NBD2, ascribing this molecule to class II correctors. Our study indicates that the continuous development and testing of combinations of correctors targeting different structural and functional defects of mutant CFTR is the best strategy to ensure a valuable therapeutic perspective to a larger cohort of CF patients.",34680050,PMC8533355,10.3390/biom11101417,,2021,"Brandas C, Ludovico A, Parodi A, Moran O, Millo E, Cichero E, Baroni D.",Y,MED
A multinational report to characterise SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with cystic fibrosis.,"Information is lacking on the clinical impact of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, on people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Our aim was to characterise SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with cystic fibrosis.Methods: Anonymised data submitted by each participating country to their National CF Registry was reported using a standardised template, then collated and summarised.Results: 40 cases have been reported across 8 countries. Of the 40 cases, 31 (78%) were symptomatic for SARS-CoV-2 at presentation, with 24 (60%) having a fever. 70% have recovered, 30% remain unresolved at time of reporting, and no deaths have been submitted.Conclusions: This early report shows good recovery from SARS-CoV-2 in this heterogeneous CF cohort. The disease course does not seem to differ from the general population, but the current numbers are too small to draw firm conclusions and people with CF should continue to strictly follow public health advice to protect themselves from infection.",32376098,PMC7183287,10.1016/j.jcf.2020.04.012,,2020,"Cosgriff R, Ahern S, Bell SC, Brownlee K, Burgel PR, Byrnes C, Corvol H, Cheng SY, Elbert A, Faro A, Goss CH, Gulmans V, Marshall BC, McKone E, Middleton PG, Ruseckaite R, Stephenson AL, Carr SB, Global Registry Harmonization Group.",Y,MED
Pancreatic endocrine and exocrine signaling and crosstalk in physiological and pathological status.,"The pancreas, an organ with dual functions, regulates blood glucose levels through the endocrine system by secreting hormones such as insulin and glucagon. It also aids digestion through the exocrine system by secreting digestive enzymes. Complex interactions and signaling mechanisms between the endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas play a crucial role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and overall health. Compelling evidence indicates direct and indirect crosstalk between the endocrine and exocrine parts, influencing the development of diseases affecting both. From a developmental perspective, the exocrine and endocrine parts share the same origin-the ""tip-trunk"" domain. In certain circumstances, pancreatic exocrine cells may transdifferentiate into endocrine-like cells, such as insulin-secreting cells. Additionally, several pancreatic diseases, including pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis, and diabetes, exhibit potential relevance to both endocrine and exocrine functions. Endocrine cells may communicate with exocrine cells directly through cytokines or indirectly by regulating the immune microenvironment. This crosstalk affects the onset and progression of these diseases. This review summarizes the history and milestones of findings related to the exocrine and endocrine pancreas, their embryonic development, phenotypic transformations, signaling roles in health and disease, the endocrine-exocrine crosstalk from the perspective of diseases, and potential therapeutic targets.

"Local and Systemic Alterations of the L-Arginine/Nitric Oxide Pathway in Sputum, Blood, and Urine of Pediatric Cystic Fibrosis Patients and Effects of Antibiotic Treatment.","Alterations in the L-arginine (Arg)/nitric oxide (NO) pathway have been reported in cystic fibrosis (CF; OMIM 219700) as the result of various factors including systemic and local inflammatory activity in the airways. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the Arg/NO metabolism in pediatric CF patients with special emphasis on lung impairment and antibiotic treatment. Seventy CF patients and 78 healthy controls were included in the study. CF patients (43% male, median age 11.8 years) showed moderately impaired lung functions (FEV1 90.5 ± 19.1% (mean ± SD); 21 (30%) had a chronic *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (PSA) infection, and 24 (33%) had an acute exacerbation). Plasma, urinary, and sputum concentrations of the main Arg/NO metabolites, nitrate, nitrite, Arg, homoarginine (hArg), and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) were determined in pediatric CF patients and in healthy age-matched controls. Clinical parameters in CF patients included lung function and infection with PSA. Additionally, the Arg/NO pathway in sputum samples of five CF patients was analyzed before and after routine antibiotic therapy. CF patients with low fractionally exhaled NO (FENO) showed lower plasma Arg and nitrate concentrations. During acute exacerbation, sputum Arg and hArg levels were high and dropped after antibiotic treatment: Arg: pre-antibiotics: 4.14 nmol/25 mg sputum vs. post-antibiotics: 2.33 nmol/25 mg sputum, *p* = 0.008; hArg: pre-antibiotics: 0.042 nmol/25 mg sputum vs. post-antibiotics: 0.029 nmol/25 mg sputum, *p =* 0.035. The activated Arg/NO metabolism in stable CF patients may be a result of chronic inflammation. PSA infection did not play a major role regarding these differences. Exacerbation increased and antibiotic therapy decreased sputum Arg concentrations.",33255369,PMC7761143,10.3390/jcm9123802,,2020,"Hanusch B, Brinkmann F, Mayorandan S, Chobanyan-Jürgens K, Wiemers A, Jansen K, Ballmann M, Schmidt-Choudhury A, Bollenbach A, Derichs N, Tsikas D, Lücke T.",Y,MED
Corticosteroid use and increased CXCR2 levels on leukocytes are associated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor discontinuation in cystic fibrosis patients homozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-shortening genetic disease and is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Several current therapies aim at improving availability and/or function of the mutant CFTR proteins. The combination therapeutic lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi, luma/iva) partially corrects folding and potentiates CFTR function impaired by the F508del mutation. Despite the potential for clinical benefit, a substantial number of patients discontinue treatment due to intolerable adverse effects. The aim of the present study is to identify differences between individuals who continued treatment and those who discontinued due to adverse respiratory effects to potentially inform treatment decisions. Clinical data from the year prior to treatment initiation were analyzed from 82 patients homozygous for the F508del mutation treated at the Colorado Adult CF Program. Blood samples were collected from 30 of these subjects before initiation of treatment to examine expression of circulating leukocyte surface antigens and cytokines. Clinical and demographic characteristics were analyzed along with inflammatory markers to determine biomarkers of drug discontinuation. The use of oral prednisone and/or nasal budesonide in the year prior to luma/iva initiation was more prevalent in CF subjects who did not tolerate luma/iva (82% vs. 43%). Increased age, but not gender or initial lung function, was associated with higher probability of discontinuing treatment due to side effects overall. Worse lung function (lower ppFEV1, ppFEF25-75 ≤ 60%) was associated with higher incidence of discontinuing treatment due to pulmonary adverse effects. In a nested cohort of patients, increased surface levels of CXCR2 on CD14+CD16- monocytes were associated with discontinuation. Overall, the patients who tolerated luma/iva were distinguishable from those who did not tolerate the drug based on clinical and cellular markers obtained prior to treatment initiation.",30540818,PMC6291130,10.1371/journal.pone.0209026,,2018,"Pohl K, Nichols DP, Taylor-Cousar JL, Saavedra MT, Strand MJ, Nick JA, Bratcher PE.",Y,MED
Airway Inflammation and Host Responses in the Era of CFTR Modulators.,"The arrival of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators as a new class of treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF) in 2012 represented a pivotal advance in disease management, as these small molecules directly target the upstream underlying protein defect. Further advancements in the development and scope of these genotype-specific therapies have been transformative for an increasing number of people with CF (PWCF). Despite clear improvements in CFTR function and clinical endpoints such as lung function, body mass index (BMI), and frequency of pulmonary exacerbations, current evidence suggests that CFTR modulators do not prevent continued decline in lung function, halt disease progression, or ameliorate pathogenic organisms in those with established lung disease. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether their restorative effects extend to dysfunctional CFTR expressed in phagocytes and other immune cells, which could modulate airway inflammation. In this review, we explore the effects of CFTR modulators on airway inflammation, infection, and their influence on the impaired pulmonary host defences associated with CF lung disease. We also consider the role of inflammation-directed therapies in light of the widespread clinical use of CFTR modulators and identify key areas for future research.",32887484,PMC7504341,10.3390/ijms21176379,,2020,"Keown K, Brown R, Doherty DF, Houston C, McKelvey MC, Creane S, Linden D, McAuley DF, Kidney JC, Weldon S, Downey DG, Taggart CC.",Y,MED
"Cystic Fibrosis: From Qualification to Lung Transplantation, a Single Center Experience.","BACKGROUND Cystic fibrosis (CF) is congenital multisystem disorder, that leads to gradual deterioration of pulmonary function. Advancements in therapy of CF-related lung disease have delayed its progression. However, lung transplantation remains the only therapeutic option for majority of such patients. Aim of the study was to assess qualification process and outcome of lung transplantation as a treatment of CF patients qualified in a single center between 2011 and 2018. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study assessed 41 patients who were qualified to be treated by means of lung transplantation due to CF in Lung Transplant Program of Silesian Center for Heart Diseases between 2011 and 2018. Analysis of patients during qualification process and after lung transplantation was performed. Lung recipients were observed during 1-year follow-up by means of pulmonary function tests. RESULTS 1-year survival was noted among 80% of the patients; 3-year survival and 5-year survival were noted among 70% of the recipients. Mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) increased after lung transplantation: 21.19% at qualification; and 76.67% at 12 months after lung transplantation. Mean forced vital capacity (FVC) results also improved: 34.18% at qualification and 78.34% at 12 months after lung transplantation. The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) before and after treatment noted an increase of 175.55 m.

Uncontrolled Extensions of Clinical Trials and the Use of External Controls-Scoping Opportunities and Methods.,"Increased interest in real-world evidence (RWE) for clinical and regulatory decision making and the need to evaluate long-term benefits and risks of pharmaceutical products raise the importance of understanding the use of external controls (ECs) for uncontrolled extensions of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We searched clinicaltrials.gov from 2009 to 2019 for uncontrolled extensions and assessed the use of ECs in the trial protocol registry and PubMed. We present characteristics of identified uncontrolled extensions, their adoption of ECs, and a qualitative appraisal of published uncontrolled extensions with ECs according to good pharmacoepidemiologic practice. The number of uncontrolled extensions increased slightly across the study period, resulting in a total of 1,115 studies. Most originated from phase III RCTs (62.2%) and specified safety outcomes (61.9% among those with specified outcomes). Most uncontrolled extensions incorporated no control group with only 7 out of 1,115 (0.6%) employing ECs. For those studies with ECs, all involved treatments for rare conditions and assessment of effectiveness. Attempts to balance comparison groups varied from none mentioned to propensity score matching. We noted consistent deficiencies in outcome ascertainment methods and approaches to address attrition bias. The contrast of the large and growing number of uncontrolled extensions with the small number of studies that utilized ECs showed clear opportunities for enhancement in design, measurement, and analysis of uncontrolled extensions to allow causal inferences on long-term treatment effects. As extensions continue to expand within RWE regulatory frameworks, development of guidelines for use of EC with uncontrolled extensions is needed.",34165790,PMC9290853,10.1002/cpt.2346,,2022,"Wang CY, Berlin JA, Gertz B, Davis K, Li J, Dreyer NA, Zhou W, Seeger JD, Santanello N, Winterstein AG.",Y,MED
Preclinical Studies of a Rare CF-Causing Mutation in the Second Nucleotide Binding Domain (c.3700A>G) Show Robust Functional Rescue in Primary Nasal Cultures by Novel CFTR Modulators.,"The combination therapies ORKAMBITM and TRIKAFTATM are approved for people who have the F508del mutation on at least one allele. In this study we examine the effects of potentiator and corrector combinations on the rare mutation c.3700A>G. This mutation produces a cryptic splice site that deletes six amino acids in NBD2 (I1234-R1239del). Like F508del it causes protein misprocessing and reduced chloride channel function. We show that a novel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR modulator triple combination (AC1, corrector, AC2-2, co-potentiator and AP2, potentiator), rescued I1234-R1239del-CFTR activity to WT-CFTR level in HEK293 cells. Moreover, we show that although the response to ORKAMBI was modest in nasal epithelial cells from two individuals homozygous for I1234-R1239del-CFTR, a substantial functional rescue was achieved with the novel triple combination. Interestingly, while both the novel CFTR triple combination and TRIKAFTATM treatment showed functional rescue in gene-edited I1234-R1239del-CFTR-expressing HBE cells and in nasal cells from two CF patients heterozygous for I1234-R1239del/W1282X, nasal cells homozygous for I1234-R1239del-CFTR showed no significant response to the TRIKAFTATM combination. These data suggest a potential benefit of CFTR modulators on the functional rescue of I1234-R1239del -CFTR, which arises from the rare CF-causing mutation c.3700A>G, and highlight that patient tissues are crucial to our full understanding of functional rescue in rare CFTR mutations.",33167369,PMC7712331,10.3390/jpm10040209,,2020,"Laselva O, McCormack J, Bartlett C, Ip W, Gunawardena TNA, Ouyang H, Eckford PDW, Gonska T, Moraes TJ, Bear CE.",Y,MED
Probing Allosteric Hsp70 Inhibitors by Molecular Modelling Studies to Expedite the Development of Novel Combined F508del CFTR Modulators.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by different mutations related to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein (CFTR), with F508del being the most common. Pioneering the development of CFTR modulators, thanks to the development of effective correctors or potentiators, more recent studies deeply encouraged the administration of triple combination therapeutics. However, combinations of molecules interacting with other proteins involved in functionality of the CFTR channel recently arose as a promising approach to address a large rescue of F508del-CFTR. In this context, the design of compounds properly targeting the molecular chaperone Hsp70, such as the allosteric inhibitor MKT-077, proved to be effective for the development of indirect CFTR modulators, endowed with ability to amplify the accumulation of the rescued protein. Herein we performed structure-based studies of a number of allosteric HSP70 inhibitors, considering the recent X-ray crystallographic structure of the human enzyme. This allowed us to point out the main interaction supporting the binding mode of MKT-077, as well as of the related analogues. In particular, cation-π and π-π stacking with the conserve residue Tyr175 deeply stabilized inhibitor binding at the HSP70 cavity. Molecular docking studies had been followed by QSAR analysis and then by virtual screening of aminoaryl thiazoles (**I**-**IIIa**) as putative HSP70 inhibitors. Their effectiveness as CFTR modulators has been verified by biological assays, in combination with VX-809, whose positive results confirmed the reliability of the whole applied computational method. Along with this, the ""in-silico"" prediction of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties highlighted, once more, that AATs may represent a chemical class to be further investigated for the rational design of novel combination of compounds for CF treatment.",34959696,PMC8709398,10.3390/ph14121296,,2021,"Sabbadini R, Pesce E, Parodi A, Mustorgi E, Bruzzone S, Pedemonte N, Casale M, Millo E, Cichero E.",Y,MED
Impact of clonally-related Burkholderia contaminans strains in two patients attending an Italian cystic fibrosis centre: a case report.,"Background: Burkholderia contaminans is one of the 20 closely related bacterial of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, a group of bacteria that are ubiquitous in the environment and capable of infecting people with cystic fibrosis (CF). This species is an emerging pathogen and it has been widely isolated from CF patients in Argentina, Spain, Portugal, Australia, Canada, USA with a low prevalence in Ireland, France, Russia, Switzerland, Czech Republic, and Italy. This is the first report of B. contaminans affecting two Italian CF patients attending the same CF Centre. We correlate B. contaminans colonisation with lung function decline and co-infection with other clinically relevant CF pathogens.Case presentation: B. contaminans was identified by Multi Locus Sequence Typing in routine sputum analysis of two Caucasian CF women homozygous for Phe508del CFTR mutation. Sequence Type 102 was detected in both strains. It is known that B. contaminans ST102 was isolated both from CF and non-CF patients, with an intercontinental spread across the world. Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA analysis revealed the genetic relatedness between the two strains. We examined their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, comparing the latter with that recorded for other B. contaminans isolated from different countries. We also described key virulence factors possibly linked with a clinical outcome. Specifically, we attempted to correlate colonization with the incidence of acute exacerbation of symptoms and lung function decline.Conclusions: This case presentation suggests that acquisition of B. contaminans ST102 is not directly associated with a lung function decline. We retain that the presence of other CF pathogens (i.e. MRSA and Trichosporon) along with B. contaminans ST102 might have contributed to the worsening of clinical conditions in our CF patients. The circumstances leading to the establishment of B. contaminans ST102 infections are still unknown. We highlight the importance to proper detect and typing bacteria implicated in CF infection by using molecular techniques.",31464603,PMC6714384,10.1186/s12890-019-0923-6,,2019,"Savi D, Quattrucci S, Trancassini M, Dalmastri C, De Biase RV, Maggisano M, Palange P, Bevivino A.",Y,MED
Molecular Mechanism of Action of Trimethylangelicin Derivatives as CFTR Modulators.,"The psoralen-related compound, 4,6,4'-trimethylangelicin (TMA) potentiates the cAMP/PKA-dependent activation of WT-CFTR and rescues F508del-CFTR-dependent chloride secretion in both primary and secondary airway cells homozygous for the F508del mutation. We recently demonstrated that TMA, like lumacaftor (VX-809), stabilizes the first membrane-spanning domain (MSD1) and enhances the interface between NBD1 and ICL4 (MSD2). TMA also demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties, via reduction of IL-8 expression, thus making TMA a promising agent for treatment of cystic fibrosis. Unfortunately, TMA was also found to display potential phototoxicity and mutagenicity, despite the fact that photo-reactivity is absent when the compound is not directly irradiated with UVA light. Due to concerns about these toxic effects, new TMA analogs, characterized by identical or better activity profiles and minimized or reduced side effects, were synthesized by modifying specific structural features on the TMA scaffold, thus generating compounds with no mutagenicity and phototoxicity. Among these compounds, we found TMA analogs which maintained the potentiation activity of CFTR in FRT-YFP-G551D cells. Nanomolar concentrations of these analogs significantly rescued F508del CFTR-dependent chloride efflux in FRT-YFP-F508del, HEK-293 and CF bronchial epithelial cells. We then investigated the ability of TMA analogs to enhance the stable expression of varying CFTR truncation mutants in HEK-293 cells, with the aim of studying the mechanism of their corrector activity. Not surprisingly, MSD1 was the smallest domain stabilized by TMA analogs, as previously observed for TMA. Moreover, we found that TMA analogs were not effective on F508del-CFTR protein which was already stabilized by a second-site mutation at the NBD1-ICL4 interface. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that these TMA analogs mediate correction by modifying MSD1 and indirectly stabilizing the interface between NBD1 and CL4.",30022950,PMC6039571,10.3389/fphar.2018.00719,,2018,"Laselva O, Marzaro G, Vaccarin C, Lampronti I, Tamanini A, Lippi G, Gambari R, Cabrini G, Bear CE, Chilin A, Dechecchi MC.",Y,MED
Inflammation in children with cystic fibrosis: contribution of bacterial production of long-chain fatty acids.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects >70,000 people worldwide, yet the microbiologic trigger for pulmonary exacerbations (PExs) remains unknown. The objective of this study was to identify changes in bacterial metabolic pathways associated with clinical status.Methods: Respiratory samples were collected at hospital admission for PEx, end of intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatment, and follow-up from 27 hospitalized children with CF. Bacterial DNA was extracted and shotgun DNA sequencing was performed. MetaPhlAn2 and HUMAnN2 were used to evaluate bacterial taxonomic and pathway relative abundance, while DESeq2 was used to evaluate differential abundance based on clinical status.Results: The mean age of study participants was 10 years; 85% received combination IV antibiotic therapy (beta-lactam plus a second agent). Long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) biosynthesis pathways were upregulated in follow-up samples compared to end of treatment: gondoate (p = 0.012), oleate (p = 0.048), palmitoleate (p = 0.043), and pathways of fatty acid elongation (p = 0.012). Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Escherichia sp. were also more prevalent in follow-up compared to PEx (p < 0.001).Conclusions: LCFAs may be associated with persistent infection of opportunistic pathogens. Future studies should more closely investigate the role of LCFA production by lung bacteria in the transition from baseline wellness to PEx in persons with CF.Impact: Increased levels of LCFAs are found after IV antibiotic treatment in persons with CF. LCFAs have previously been associated with increased lung inflammation in asthma. This is the first report of LCFAs in the airway of persons with CF. This research provides support that bacterial production of LCFAs may be a contributor to inflammation in persons with CF. Future studies should evaluate LCFAs as predictors of future PExs.",33654282,PMC8370878,10.1038/s41390-021-01419-4,,2021,"Felton E, Burrell A, Chaney H, Sami I, Koumbourlis AC, Freishtat RJ, Crandall KA, Hahn A.",Y,MED
Projecting the impact of triple CFTR modulator therapy on intravenous antibiotic requirements in cystic fibrosis using patient registry data combined with treatment effects from randomised trials.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening genetic disease, affecting around 10 500 people in the UK. Precision medicines have been developed to treat specific CF-gene mutations. The newest, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELEX/TEZ/IVA), has been found to be highly effective in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and became available to a large proportion of UK CF patients in 2020. Understanding the potential health economic impacts of ELEX/TEZ/IVA is vital to planning service provision.Methods: We combined observational UK CF Registry data with RCT results to project the impact of ELEX/TEZ/IVA on total days of intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatment at a population level. Registry data from 2015 to 2017 were used to develop prediction models for IV days over a 1-year period using several predictors, and to estimate 1-year population total IV days based on standards of care pre-ELEX/TEZ/IVA. We considered two approaches to imposing the impact of ELEX/TEZ/IVA on projected outcomes using effect estimates from RCTs: approach 1 based on effect estimates on FEV1% and approach 2 based on effect estimates on exacerbation rate.Results: ELEX/TEZ/IVA is expected to result in significant reductions in population-level requirements for IV antibiotics of 16.1% (~17 800 days) using approach 1 and 43.6% (~39 500 days) using approach 2. The two approaches require different assumptions. Increased understanding of the mechanisms through which ELEX/TEZ/IVA acts on these outcomes would enable further refinements to our projections.Conclusions: This work contributes to increased understanding of the changing healthcare needs of people with CF and illustrates how Registry data can be used in combination with RCT evidence to estimate population-level treatment impacts.",34556554,PMC8940731,10.1136/thoraxjnl-2020-216265,,2022,"Keogh RH, Cosgriff R, Andrinopoulou ER, Brownlee KG, Carr SB, Diaz-Ordaz K, Granger E, Jewell NP, Lewin A, Leyrat C, Schlüter DK, van Smeden M, Szczesniak RD, Connett GJ.",Y,MED

However, adherence to the dietary recommendations for CF appears suboptimal and burdensome for most children and adolescents with CF, leading to malnutrition, inadequate growth, compromised lung function and increased risk for respiratory infections. A cross-sectional approach was deployed to examine the degree of adherence to the nutrition recommendations and diet quality among children with CF. A total of 76 children were recruited from Aghia Sophia's Children Hospital, in Athens, Greece. In their majority, participants attained their ideal body weight, met the recommendations for energy and fat intake, exceeding the goal for saturated fatty acids consumption.

Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes: Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Challenges.,"Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is among the most common extrapulmonary co-morbidity associated with cystic fibrosis (CF), affecting an estimated 50% of adults with the condition. Cystic fibrosis is prevalent in 1 in every 2500 Caucasian live births and is caused by a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene. Mutated CFTR leads to dehydrated epithelial surfaces and a build-up of mucus in a variety of tissues including the lungs and pancreas. The leading cause of mortality in CF is repeated respiratory bacterial infections, which prompts a decline in lung function. Co-morbid diabetes promotes bacterial colonisation of the airways and exacerbates the deterioration in respiratory health. Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes is associated with a 6-fold higher mortality rate compared with those with CF alone. The management of CFRD adds a further burden for the patient and creates new therapeutic challenges for the clinical team. Several proposed hypotheses on how CFRD develops have emerged, including exocrine-driven fibrosis and destruction of the entire pancreas and contrasting theories on the direct or indirect impact of CFTR mutation on islet function. The current review outlines recent data on the impact of CFTR on endocrine pancreatic function and discusses the use of conventional diabetic therapies and new CFTR-correcting drugs on the treatment of CFRD.",31191067,PMC6539575,10.1177/1179551419851770,,2019,"Kelsey R, Manderson Koivula FN, McClenaghan NH, Kelly C.",Y,MED

However, within these new innovative medicines, results for CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators indicate that one major challenge for turning a CF concept product into an actual medicine for the benefit of patients resides in the fact that, although pre-clinical models have shown good predictability for certain mutations, a good correlation to clinical end-points or biomarkers (*e.g.* forced expiratory volume in 1 s and sweat chloride) for all mutations has not yet been achieved. In this respect, the use of alternative end-points and innovative nonclinical models could be helpful for the understanding of those translational discrepancies. Collaborative endeavours to promote further research and development in these areas as well as early dialogue with the regulatory bodies available at the European competent authorities are recommended.",29653946,PMC9488862,10.1183/16000617.0124-2017,,2018,"Ponzano S, Nigrelli G, Fregonese L, Eichler I, Bertozzi F, Bandiera T, Galietta LJV, Papaluca M.",Y,MED
Highway to Cell: Selection of the Best Cell-Penetrating Peptide to Internalize the CFTR-Stabilizing iCAL36 Peptide.,"Therapeutic peptides have regained interest as they can address unmet medical needs and can be an excellent complement to pharmaceutic small molecules and other macromolecular therapeutics. Over the past decades, correctors and potentiators of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride ion channel causing cystic fibrosis (CF) when mutated, were developed to reduce the symptoms of the patients. In this context, we have previously designed a CFTR-stabilizing iCAL36 peptide able to further increase the CFTR amount in epithelial cells, thereby resulting in a higher CFTR activity. In the present study, optimization of the peptidyl inhibitor was performed by coupling five different cell-penetrating peptides (CPP), which are Tat, dTat, TatRI (*retro-inverso*), MPG, and Penetratin. Screening of the internalization properties of these CPP-iCAL36 peptides under different conditions (with or without serum or endocytosis inhibitors, etc.) was performed to select TatRI as the optimal CPP for iCAL36 delivery. More importantly, using this TatRI-iCAL36 peptide, we were able to reveal for the first time an additive increase in the CFTR amount in the presence of VX-445/VX-809 compared to VX-445/VX-809 treatment alone. This finding is a significant contribution to the development of CFTR-stabilizing peptides in addition to currently used treatments (small-molecule correctors or potentiators) for CF patients.",35456644,PMC9032934,10.3390/pharmaceutics14040808,,2022,"Seisel Q, Lakumpa I, Josse E, Vivès E, Varilh J, Taulan-Cadars M, Boisguérin P.",Y,MED
Personalized Medicine Based on Nasal Epithelial Cells: Comparative Studies with Rectal Biopsies and Intestinal Organoids.,"As highly effective CFTR modulator therapies (HEMT) emerge, there is an unmet need to find effective drugs for people with CF (PwCF) with ultra-rare mutations who are too few for classical clinical trials and for whom there are no drug discovery programs. Therefore, biomarkers reliably predicting the benefit from CFTR modulator therapies are essential to find effective drugs for PwCF through personalized approaches termed theranostics. Here, we assess CFTR basal function and the individual responses to CFTR modulators in primary human nasal epithelial (pHNE) cells from PwCF carrying rare mutations and compare these measurements with those in native rectal biopsies and intestinal organoids, respectively, in the same individual. The basal function in pHNEs shows good correlation with CFTR basal function in rectal biopsies. In parallel, CFTR rescue in pHNEs by CFTR modulators correlates to that in intestinal organoids. Altogether, results show that pHNEs are a bona fide theranostic model to assess CFTR rescue by CFTR modulator drugs, in particular for PwCF and rare mutations.",34065744,PMC8156700,10.3390/jpm11050421,,2021,"Silva IAL, Railean V, Duarte A, Amaral MD.",Y,MED
GM1 as Adjuvant of Innovative Therapies for Cystic Fibrosis Disease.,"Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein is expressed at the apical plasma membrane (PM) of different epithelial cells. The most common mutation responsible for the onset of cystic fibrosis (CF), F508del, inhibits the biosynthesis and transport of the protein at PM, and also presents gating and stability defects of the membrane anion channel upon its rescue by the use of correctors and potentiators. This prompted a multiple drug strategy for F508delCFTR aimed simultaneously at its rescue, functional potentiation and PM stabilization. Since ganglioside GM1 is involved in the functional stabilization of transmembrane proteins, we investigated its role as an adjuvant to increase the effectiveness of CFTR modulators. According to our results, we found that GM1 resides in the same PM microenvironment as CFTR. In CF cells, the expression of the mutated channel is accompanied by a decrease in the PM GM1 content. Interestingly, by the exogenous administration of GM1, it becomes a component of the PM, reducing the destabilizing effect of the potentiator VX-770 on rescued CFTR protein expression/function and improving its stabilization. This evidence could represent a starting point for developing innovative therapeutic strategies based on the co-administration of GM1, correctors and potentiators, with the aim of improving F508del CFTR function.",32599772,PMC7350007,10.3390/ijms21124486,,2020,"Mancini G, Loberto N, Olioso D, Dechecchi MC, Cabrini G, Mauri L, Bassi R, Schiumarini D, Chiricozzi E, Lippi G, Pesce E, Sonnino S, Pedemonte N, Tamanini A, Aureli M.",Y,MED
Role of the SLC26A9 Chloride Channel as Disease Modifier and Potential Therapeutic Target in Cystic Fibrosis.,"The solute carrier family 26, member 9 (SLC26A9) is an epithelial chloride channel that is expressed in several organs affected in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) including the lungs, the pancreas, and the intestine. Emerging evidence suggests SLC26A9 as a modulator of wild-type and mutant CFTR function, and as a potential alternative target to circumvent the basic ion transport defect caused by deficient CFTR-mediated chloride transport in CF. In this review, we summarize *in vitro* studies that revealed multifaceted molecular and functional interactions between SLC26A9 and CFTR that may be implicated in normal transepithelial chloride secretion in health, as well as impaired chloride/fluid transport in CF. Further, we focus on recent genetic association studies and investigations utilizing genetically modified mouse models that identified SLC26A9 as a disease modifier and supported an important role of this alternative chloride channel in the pathophysiology of several organ manifestations in CF, as well as other chronic lung diseases such as asthma and non-CF bronchiectasis. Collectively, these findings and the overlapping endogenous expression with CFTR suggest SLC26A9 an attractive novel therapeutic target that may be exploited to restore epithelial chloride secretion in patients with CF irrespective of their *CFTR* genotype. In addition, pharmacological activation of SLC26A9 may help to augment the effect of CFTR modulator therapies in patients with CF carrying responsive mutations such as the most common disease-causing mutation F508del-CFTR. However, future research and development including the identification of compounds that activate SLC26A9-mediated chloride transport are needed to explore this alternative chloride channel as a therapeutic target in CF and potentially other muco-obstructive lung diseases.",30327603,PMC6174851,10.3389/fphar.2018.01112,,2018,"Balázs A, Mall MA.",Y,MED
Cystic fibrosis: current therapeutic targets and future approaches.,"Objectives: Study of currently approved drugs and exploration of future clinical development pipeline therapeutics for cystic fibrosis, and possible limitations in their use.Methods: Extensive literature search using individual and a combination of key words related to cystic fibrosis therapeutics.Key findings: Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in CFTR gene leading to abnormality of chloride channels in mucus and sweat producing cells. Respiratory system and GIT are primarily involved but eventually multiple organs are affected leading to life threatening complications. Management requires drug therapy, extensive physiotherapy and nutritional support. Previously, the focus was on symptomatic improvement and complication prevention but recently the protein rectifiers are being studied which are claimed to correct underlying structural and functional abnormalities. Some improvement is observed by the corrector drugs. Other promising approaches are gene therapy, targeting of cellular interactomes, and newer drugs for symptomatic improvement.Conclusions: The treatment has a long way to go as most of the existing therapeutics is for older children. Other limiting factors include mutation class, genetic profile, drug interactions, adverse effects, and cost. Novel approaches like gene transfer/gene editing, disease modeling and search for alternative targets are warranted.",28449677,PMC5408469,10.1186/s12967-017-1193-9,,2017,"Rafeeq MM, Murad HAS.",Y,MED
Correction of CFTR function in nasal epithelial cells from cystic fibrosis patients predicts improvement of respiratory function by CFTR modulators.,"Clinical studies with modulators of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein have demonstrated that functional restoration of the mutated CFTR can lead to substantial clinical benefit. However, studies have shown highly variable patient responses. The objective of this study was to determine a biomarker predictive of the clinical response. CFTR function was assessed in vivo via nasal potential difference (NPD) and in human nasal epithelial (HNE) cultures by the response to Forskolin/IBMX and the CFTR potentiator VX-770 in short-circuit-current (∆IscF/I+V) experiments. CFTR expression was evaluated by apical membrane fluorescence semi-quantification. Isc measurements discriminated CFTR function between controls, healthy heterozygotes, patients homozygous for the severe F508del mutation and patients with genotypes leading to absent or residual function. ∆IscF/I+V correlated with CFTR cellular apical expression and NPD measurements. The CFTR correctors lumacaftor and tezacaftor significantly increased the ∆IscF/I+V response to about 25% (SEM = 4.4) of the WT-CFTR level and the CFTR apical expression to about 22% (SEM = 4.6) of the WT-CFTR level in F508del/F508del HNE cells. The level of CFTR correction in HNE cultures significantly correlated with the FEV1 change at 6 months in 8 patients treated with CFTR modulators. We provide the first evidence that correction of CFTR function in HNE cell cultures can predict respiratory improvement by CFTR modulators.",28785019,PMC5547155,10.1038/s41598-017-07504-1,,2017,"Pranke IM, Hatton A, Simonin J, Jais JP, Le Pimpec-Barthes F, Carsin A, Bonnette P, Fayon M, Stremler-Le Bel N, Grenet D, Thumerel M, Mazenq J, Urbach V, Mesbahi M, Girodon-Boulandet E, Hinzpeter A, Edelman A, Sermet-Gaudelus I.",Y,MED
Functional and metabolic impairment in cigarette smoke-exposed macrophages is tied to oxidative stress.,"Cigarette smoke inhalation exposes the respiratory system to thousands of potentially toxic substances and causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is characterized by cycles of inflammation and infection with a dysregulated immune response contributing to disease progression. While smoking cessation can slow the damage in COPD, lung immunity remains impaired. Alveolar macrophages (AMΦ) are innate immune cells strategically poised at the interface between lungs, respiratory pathogens, and environmental toxins including cigarette smoke. We studied the effects of cigarette smoke on model THP-1 and peripheral blood monocyte derived macrophages, and discovered a marked inhibition of bacterial phagocytosis which was replicated in primary human AMΦ. Cigarette smoke decreased AMΦ cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) expression, previously shown to be integral to phagocytosis. In contrast to cystic fibrosis macrophages, smoke-exposed THP-1 and AMΦ failed to augment phagocytosis in the presence of CFTR modulators. Cigarette smoke also inhibited THP-1 and AMΦ mitochondrial respiration while inducing glycolysis and reactive oxygen species. These effects were mitigated by the free radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine, which also reverted phagocytosis to baseline levels. Collectively these results implicate metabolic dysfunction as a key factor in the toxicity of cigarette smoke to AMΦ, and illuminate avenues of potential intervention.",31270372,PMC6610132,10.1038/s41598-019-46045-7,,2019,"Aridgides DS, Mellinger DL, Armstrong DA, Hazlett HF, Dessaint JA, Hampton TH, Atkins GT, Carroll JL, Ashare A.",Y,MED
Patient-reported outcomes in patients with cystic fibrosis with a G551D mutation on ivacaftor treatment: results from a cross-sectional study.,"Background: Clinical studies demonstrate that ivacaftor (IVA) improves health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients aged ≥6 years with cystic fibrosis (CF). The real-world impact of IVA and standard of care (SOC) in groups of patients with G551D and F508del mutations, respectively, was assessed using a survey comprising disease-specific and generic HRQoL measures.Methods: Patients with CF aged ≥12 years, or aged 6-11 years with caregiver support, with either (1) a G551D mutation and receiving IVA (G551D/IVA) for ≥3 months, or (2) homozygous for F508del and receiving SOC before lumacaftor/IVA availability (F508del/SOC), were eligible to participate in a cross-sectional survey. Demographic and clinical characteristics, and HRQoL measures were compared between patient groups, and multiple regression analyses were conducted.Results: After differences in patient demographic and clinical characteristics were controlled for, significantly better scores were observed in the G551D/IVA group than in the F508del/SOC group on multiple domains of the validated Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised and the EuroQol 5-dimensions 5-level questionnaire.Conclusions: G551D/IVA patients reported better HRQoL than F508del/SOC patients on generic and disease-specific measures in a real-world setting.",31409396,PMC6693259,10.1186/s12890-019-0887-6,,2019,"Bell SC, Mainz JG, MacGregor G, Madge S, Macey J, Fridman M, Suthoff ED, Narayanan S, Kinnman N.",Y,MED
The potentially beneficial central nervous system activity profile of ivacaftor and its metabolites.,"Ivacaftor-lumacaftor and ivacaftor are two new breakthrough cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance modulators. The interactions of ivacaftor and its two metabolites hydroxymethylivacaftor (iva-M1) and ivacaftorcarboxylate (iva-M6) with neurotransmitter receptors were investigated in radioligand binding assays. Ivacaftor displayed significant affinity to the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) 5-HT2C receptor (p*K*i=6.06±0.03), β3-adrenergic receptor (p*K*i=5.71±0.07), δ-opioid receptor (p*K*i=5.59±0.06) and the dopamine transporter (p*K*i=5.50±0.20); iva-M1 displayed significant affinity to the 5-HT2C receptor (p*K*i=5.81±0.04) and the muscarinic M3 receptor (p*K*i=5.70±0.10); iva-M6 displayed significant affinity to the 5-HT2A receptor (p*K*i=7.33±0.05). The *in vivo* central nervous system activity of ivacaftor (40 mg·kg-1 intraperitoneally for 21 days) was assessed in a chronic mouse model of depression. In the forced swim test, the ivacaftor-treated group displayed decreased immobility (52.8±7.6 s), similarly to fluoxetine (33.8±11.0 s), and increased climbing/swimming activity (181.5±9.2 s). In the open field test, ivacaftor produced higher locomotor activity than the fluoxetine group, measured both as mean number of paw touches (ivacaftor 81.1±9.6 *versus* fluoxetine 57.9±9.5) and total distance travelled (ivacaftor 120.6±16.8 cm *versus* fluoxetine 84.5±16.0 cm) in 600 s. Treatment of 23 cystic fibrosis patients with ivacaftor-lumacaftor resulted in significant improvements in quality of life (including anxiety) in all five domains of the AweScoreCF questionnaire (p=0.092-0.096). Our findings suggest ivacaftor displays potential clinical anxiolytic and stimulating properties, and may have beneficial effects on mood.",29560360,PMC5850045,10.1183/23120541.00127-2017,,2018,"Schneider EK, McQuade RM, Carbone VC, Reyes-Ortega F, Wilson JW, Button B, Saito A, Poole DP, Hoyer D, Li J, Velkov T.",Y,MED
Opportunities and Challenges for Inhalable Nanomedicine Formulations in Respiratory Diseases: A Review.,"Lungs experience frequent interactions with the external environment and have an abundant supply of blood; therefore, they are susceptible to invasion by pathogenic microorganisms and tumor cells. However, the limited pharmacokinetics of conventional drugs in the lungs poses a clinical challenge. The emergence of different nano-formulations has been facilitated by advancements in nanotechnology. Inhaled nanomedicines exhibit better targeting and prolonged therapeutic effects. Although nano-formulations have great potential, they still present several unknown risks. Herein, we review the (1) physiological anatomy of the lungs and their biological barriers, (2) pharmacokinetics and toxicology of nanomaterial formulations in the lungs; (3) current nanomaterials that can be applied to the respiratory system and related design strategies, and (4) current applications of inhaled nanomaterials in treating respiratory disorders, vaccine design, and imaging detection based on the characteristics of different nanomaterials. Finally, (5) we analyze and summarize the challenges and prospects of nanomaterials for respiratory disease applications. We believe that nanomaterials, particularly inhaled nano-formulations, have excellent prospects for application in respiratory diseases. However, we emphasize that the simultaneous toxic side effects of biological nanomaterials must be considered during the application of these emerging medicines. This study aims to offer comprehensive guidelines and valuable insights for conducting research on nanomaterials in the domain of the respiratory system.",38384321,PMC10880554,10.2147/ijn.s446919,,2024,"Feng X, Shi Y, Zhang Y, Lei F, Ren R, Tang X.",Y,MED
Allosteric folding correction of F508del and rare CFTR mutants by elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (Trikafta) combination.,"Based on its clinical benefits, Trikafta - the combination of folding correctors VX-661 (tezacaftor), VX-445 (elexacaftor), and the gating potentiator VX-770 (ivacaftor) - was FDA approved for treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) carrying deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del) of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) on at least 1 allele. Neither the mechanism of action of VX-445 nor the susceptibility of rare CF folding mutants to Trikafta are known. Here, we show that, in human bronchial epithelial cells, VX-445 synergistically restores F508del-CFTR processing in combination with type I or II correctors that target the nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1) membrane spanning domains (MSDs) interface and NBD2, respectively, consistent with a type III corrector mechanism. This inference was supported by the VX-445 binding to and unfolding suppression of the isolated F508del-NBD1 of CFTR. The VX-661 plus VX-445 treatment restored F508del-CFTR chloride channel function in the presence of VX-770 to approximately 62% of WT CFTR in homozygous nasal epithelia. Substantial rescue of rare misprocessing mutations (S13F, R31C, G85E, E92K, V520F, M1101K, and N1303K), confined to MSD1, MSD2, NBD1, and NBD2 of CFTR, was also observed in airway epithelia, suggesting an allosteric correction mechanism and the possible application of Trikafta for patients with rare misfolding mutants of CFTR.",32853178,PMC7526550,10.1172/jci.insight.139983,,2020,"Veit G, Roldan A, Hancock MA, Da Fonte DF, Xu H, Hussein M, Frenkiel S, Matouk E, Velkov T, Lukacs GL.",Y,MED
Emerging strategies in nanotechnology to treat respiratory tract infections: realizing current trends for future clinical perspectives.,"A boom in respiratory tract infection cases has inflicted a socio-economic burden on the healthcare system worldwide, especially in developing countries. Limited alternative therapeutic options have posed a major threat to human health. Nanotechnology has brought an immense breakthrough in the pharmaceutical industry in a jiffy. The vast applications of nanotechnology ranging from early diagnosis to treatment strategies are employed for respiratory tract infections. The research avenues explored a multitude of nanosystems for effective drug delivery to the target site and combating the issues laid through multidrug resistance and protective niches of the bacteria. In this review a brief introduction to respiratory diseases and multifaceted barriers imposed by bacterial infections are enlightened. The manuscript reviewed different nanosystems, i.e. liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, nanogels, and metallic (gold and silver) which enhanced bactericidal effects, prevented biofilm formation, improved mucus penetration, and site-specific delivery.

Antiestrogen- and tamoxifen-induced effects on calcium-activated chloride currents in epithelial cells carrying the ∆F508-CFTR point mutation.,"Background: Although pharmacological treatment has increased the average life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis, the median survival of females is shorter than that of males. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens play a relevant role in the disease progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 17β-estradiol and tamoxifen citrate (TMX) on calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC) currents in human bronchial epithelial cells carrying the ΔPhe508-CFTR mutation both in homozygosis and in heterozygosis.Methods: Perforated patch clamp experiments were performed on single cells of the immortalized cell lines CFBE and IB3-1. Gramicidin (10 or 20 μM) was added to the electrode solution to reach the whole cell configuration. The electrical stimulation protocol consisted of square voltages ranging from - 80 to + 80 mV, in steps of 20 mV and with a duration of 800 msec.Results: The presence of 17β-estradiol significantly reduced the CaCC currents, both in basal conditions and in the presence of ATP (100 μM). The addition of TMX (10 μM) completely restored the currents abolished by 17β-estradiol, in basal conditions and after stimulation with ATP in both CFBE and IB3-1 cells. TMX had a strong, direct action on membrane current density, which significantly increased more than 4-fold in both cases. The membrane current stimulation produced by TMX was further enhanced by the addition of ATP. CFBE cells incubated for 24 h with 3 μM VX-809 (a CFTR corrector) and then acutely stimulated with VX-770 (a CFTR potentiator) in the presence of forskolin, showed an increase of chloride currents which were abolished by Inh-172. The chloride current density induced by TMX + ATP was, on average, greater than that obtained with VX-809 + VX-770 + forskolin. The currents elicited by TMX + ATP were abolished by the addition of NPPB, a CaCC inhibitor. The combined administration of TMX/ATP and VXs/FSK had an additional effect on chloride currents.Conclusions: Our results show that TMX restores CaCC currents inhibited by 17ß-estradiol and directly activates the transmembrane chloride currents potentiated by ATP, an effect which is mutation independent. The combined effect of TMX with current used treatments for cystic fibrosis could be of benefit to patients.",30290809,PMC6173901,10.1186/s12931-018-0901-1,,2018,"Imberti R, Garavaglia ML, Verduci I, Cannavale G, Balduzzi G, Papetti S, Mazzanti M.",Y,MED
Industry influence in healthcare harms patients: myth or maxim?,"Healthcare is a major global industry accounting for a significant proportion of government spending. Drug and medical device manufacturers are publicly traded companies with a responsibility to their shareholders to maximise profits by increasing sales. In order to achieve this, industry exerts influence over every part of healthcare including academic research, medical education, clinical guideline development, physician prescribing and through direct interactions with patients. In contrast, healthcare services seek to provide effective, safe and evidence-based treatments. This article examines interactions with industry across these domains and seeks to identify mutually beneficial relationships and potential conflict leading to patient harms. Case studies are used to illustrate these interactions. There is no single solution for improving healthcare's relationship with industry, although increased transparency has raised awareness of this issue. We briefly discuss some successful interventions that have been tried at national and regulatory level. While industry influence is widespread in healthcare and this has benefits for shareholders, healthcare practitioners have an ethical obligation to prioritise their patients' best interests. Industry interactions with healthcare professionals have a valid role in product development and distribution, but industry sponsorship of healthcare education and practice, guideline development or regulatory decision-making can have harmful consequences for patients. Healthcare practitioners need to carefully consider these issues when deciding whether to collaborate with industry.Educational aims: To explore the many areas where industry influences healthcare and the subsequent effects on patient care. Case studies are used to illustrate examples of beneficial and harmful effects of this influence.To raise awareness of the effects of industry influence and for readers to consider their own potential conflicts of interest.To suggest potential ways to improve the current system with a focus on solutions which have successfully been trialled already.",36337122,PMC9584590,10.1183/20734735.0010-2022,,2022,"Trayer J, Rowbotham NJ, Boyle RJ, Smyth AR.",Y,MED
Integrative genomic meta-analysis reveals novel molecular insights into cystic fibrosis and ΔF508-CFTR rescue.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations to CFTR, leads to severe and progressive lung disease. The most common mutant, ΔF508-CFTR, undergoes proteasomal degradation, extinguishing its anion channel function. Numerous in vitro interventions have been identified to partially rescue ΔF508-CFTR function yet remain poorly understood. Improved understanding of both the altered state of CF cells and the mechanisms of existing rescue strategies could reveal novel therapeutic strategies. Toward this aim, we measured transcriptional profiles of established temperature, genetic, and chemical interventions that rescue ΔF508-CFTR and also re-analyzed public datasets characterizing transcription in human CF vs. non-CF samples from airway and whole blood. Meta-analysis yielded a core disease signature and two core rescue signatures. To interpret these through the lens of prior knowledge, we compiled a ""CFTR Gene Set Library"" from literature. The core disease signature revealed remarkably strong connections to genes with established effects on CFTR trafficking and function and suggested novel roles of EGR1 and SGK1 in the disease state. Our data also revealed an unexpected mechanistic link between several genetic rescue interventions and the unfolded protein response. Finally, we found that C18, an analog of the CFTR corrector compound Lumacaftor, induces almost no transcriptional perturbation despite its rescue activity.",33239626,PMC7689470,10.1038/s41598-020-76347-0,,2020,"Hodos RA, Strub MD, Ramachandran S, Li L, McCray PB, Dudley JT.",Y,MED
Innovative Therapeutic Strategies for Cystic Fibrosis: Moving Forward to CRISPR Technique.,"One of the most revolutionary technologies in recent years in the field of molecular biology is CRISPR-Cas9. CRISPR technology is a promising tool for gene editing that provides researchers the opportunity to easily alter DNA sequences and modify gene function. Its many potential applications include correcting genetic defects, treating and preventing the spread of diseases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common lethal genetic diseases caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Although CF is an old acquaintance, there is still no effective/resolutive cure. Life expectancy has improved thanks to the combination of various treatments, but it is generally below average. Recently, a significant number of additional key medications have become licensed in Europe for the CF treatment including CFTR modulators. But innovative genomically-guided therapies have begun for CF and it is predictable that this will lead to rapid improvements in CF clinical disease and survival in the next decades. In this way, CRISPR-Cas9 approach may represent a valid tool to repair the CFTR mutation and hopeful results were obtained in tissue and animal models of CF disease.",29731717,PMC5920621,10.3389/fphar.2018.00396,,2018,"Marangi M, Pistritto G.",Y,MED
"Metaproteomics to Decipher CF Host-Microbiota Interactions: Overview, Challenges and Future Perspectives.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a hereditary disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene, triggering dysfunction of the anion channel in several organs including the lung and gut. The main cause of morbidity and mortality is chronic infection. The microbiota is now included among the additional factors that could contribute to the exacerbation of patient symptoms, to treatment outcome, and more generally to the phenotypic variability observed in CF patients. In recent years, various omics tools have started to shed new light on microbial communities associated with CF and host-microbiota interactions. In this context, proteomics targets the key effectors of the responses from organisms, and thus their phenotypes. Recent advances are promising in terms of gaining insights into the CF microbiota and its relation with the host. This review provides an overview of the contributions made by proteomics and metaproteomics to our knowledge of the complex host-microbiota partnership in CF. Considering the strengths and weaknesses of proteomics-based approaches in profiling the microbiota in the context of other diseases, we illustrate their potential and discuss possible strategies to overcome their limitations in monitoring both the respiratory and intestinal microbiota in sample from patients with CF.",34207804,PMC8227082,10.3390/genes12060892,,2021,"Hardouin P, Chiron R, Marchandin H, Armengaud J, Grenga L.",Y,MED
CFTR Modulator Therapy Enhances Peripheral Blood Monocyte Contributions to Immune Responses in People With Cystic Fibrosis.,"Background: CFTR modulators decrease some etiologies of CF airway inflammation; however, data indicate that non-resolving airway infection and inflammation persist in individuals with CF and chronic bacterial infections. Thus, identification of therapies that diminish airway inflammation without allowing unrestrained bacterial growth remains a critical research goal. Novel strategies for combatting deleterious airway inflammation in the CFTR modulator era require better understanding of cellular contributions to chronic CF airway disease, and how inflammatory cells change after initiation of CFTR modulator therapy. Peripheral blood monocytes, which traffic to the CF airway, can develop both pro-inflammatory and inflammation-resolving phenotypes, represent intriguing cellular targets for focused therapies. This therapeutic approach, however, requires a more detailed knowledge of CF monocyte cellular programming and phenotypes.Material and methods: In order to characterize the inflammatory phenotype of CF monocytes, and how these cells change after initiation of CFTR modulator therapy, we studied adults (n=10) with CF, chronic airway infections, and the *CFTR-R117H* mutations before and 7 days after initiation of ivacaftor. Transcriptomes of freshly isolated blood monocytes were interrogated by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) followed by pathway-based analyses. Plasma concentrations of cytokines and chemokines were evaluated by multiplex ELISA.Results: RNAseq identified approximately 50 monocyte genes for which basal expression was significantly changed in all 10 subjects after 7 days of ivacaftor. Of these, the majority were increased in expression post ivacaftor, including many genes traditionally associated with enhanced inflammation and immune responses. Pathway analyses confirmed that transcriptional programs were overwhelmingly up-regulated in monocytes after 7 days of ivacaftor, including biological modules associated with immunity, cell cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and the unfolded protein response. Ivacaftor increased plasma concentrations of CXCL2, a neutrophil chemokine secreted by monocytes and macrophages, and CCL2, a monocyte chemokine.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that ivacaftor causes acute changes in blood monocyte transcriptional profiles and plasma chemokines, and suggest that increased monocyte inflammatory signals and changes in myeloid cell trafficking may contribute to changes in airway inflammation in people taking CFTR modulators. To our knowledge, this is the first report investigating the transcriptomic response of circulating blood monocytes in CF subjects treated with a CFTR modulator.",33013356,PMC7461946,10.3389/fphar.2020.01219,,2020,"Hisert KB, Birkland TP, Schoenfelt KQ, Long ME, Grogan B, Carter S, Liles WC, McKone EF, Becker L, Manicone AM, Gharib SA.",Y,MED
Nanomechanics combined with HDX reveals allosteric drug binding sites of CFTR NBD1.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a frequent genetic disease in Caucasians that is caused by the deletion of F508 (ΔF508) in the nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1) of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The ΔF508 compromises the folding energetics of the NBD1, as well as the folding of three other CFTR domains. Combination of FDA approved corrector molecules can efficiently but incompletely rescue the ΔF508-CFTR folding and stability defect. Thus, new pharmacophores that would reinstate the wild-type-like conformational stability of the ΔF508-NBD1 would be highly beneficial. The most prominent molecule, 5-bromoindole-3-acetic acid (BIA) that can thermally stabilize the NBD1 has low potency and efficacy. To gain insights into the NBD1 (un)folding dynamics and BIA binding site localization, we combined molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, atomic force spectroscopy (AFM) and hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) experiments. We found that the NBD1 α-subdomain with three adjacent strands from the β-subdomain plays an important role in early folding steps, when crucial non-native interactions are formed via residue F508. Our AFM and HDX experiments showed that BIA associates with this α-core region and increases the resistance of the ΔF508-NBD1 against mechanical unfolding, a phenomenon that could be exploited in future developments of folding correctors.",35685375,PMC9160490,10.1016/j.csbj.2022.05.036,,2022,"Padányi R, Farkas B, Tordai H, Kiss B, Grubmüller H, Soya N, Lukács GL, Kellermayer M, Hegedűs T.",Y,MED
"European guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency: UEG, EPC, EDS, ESPEN, ESPGHAN, ESDO, and ESPCG evidence-based recommendations.","Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) is defined as a reduction in pancreatic exocrine secretion below the level that allows the normal digestion of nutrients. Pancreatic disease and surgery are the main causes of PEI. However, other conditions and upper gastrointestinal surgery can also affect the digestive function of the pancreas. PEI can cause symptoms of nutritional malabsorption and deficiencies, which affect the quality of life and increase morbidity and mortality. These guidelines were developed following the United European Gastroenterology framework for the development of high-quality clinical guidelines. After a systematic literature review, the evidence was evaluated according to the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology, as appropriate. Statements and comments were developed by the working groups and voted on using the Delphi method. The diagnosis of PEI should be based on a global assessment of symptoms, nutritional status, and a pancreatic secretion test. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), together with dietary advice and support, are the cornerstones of PEI therapy. PERT is indicated in patients with PEI that is secondary to pancreatic disease, pancreatic surgery, or other metabolic or gastroenterological conditions. Specific recommendations concerning the management of PEI under various clinical conditions are provided based on evidence and expert opinions. This evidence-based guideline summarizes the prevalence, clinical impact, and general diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for PEI, as well as the specifics of PEI in different clinical conditions.

CFTR modulator therapies - Effect on life expectancy in people with cystic fibrosis.,"CFTR modulators have dramatically changed the clinical course of CF in those fortunate enough to receive them. Inevitably, randomised controlled trials during the development of these drugs are too short to use mortality as an outcome. Evidence for their effect on life expectancy are best gained from real world registry studies specifically looking at mortality, but these are only available for ivacaftor to date. Therefore, indirect evidence must be obtained by looking at outcomes known to affect mortality and seeing the effect of these drugs on those outcomes.",32565113,PMC7255286,10.1016/j.prrv.2020.05.002,,2022,"Balfour-Lynn IM, King JA.",Y,MED
The Multifaceted Roles of MicroRNAs in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lifelong disorder affecting 1 in 3500 live births worldwide. It is a monogenetic autosomal recessive disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the chloride channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the impairment of which leads to ionic disequilibria in exocrine organs. This translates into a chronic multisystemic disease characterized by airway obstruction, respiratory infections, and pancreatic insufficiency as well as hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Molecular characterization of the mutational heterogeneity of CFTR (affected by more than 2000 variants) improved the understanding and management of CF. However, these CFTR variants are linked to different clinical manifestations and phenotypes, and they affect response to treatments. Expanding evidence suggests that multisystemic disease affects CF pathology via impairing either CFTR or proteins regulated by CFTR. Thus, altering the expression of miRNAs in vivo could constitute an appealing strategy for developing new CF therapies. In this review, we will first describe the pathophysiology and clinical management of CF. Then, we will summarize the current knowledge on altered miRNAs in CF patients, with a focus on the miRNAs involved in the deregulation of CFTR and in the modulation of inflammation. We will highlight recent findings on the potential utility of measuring circulating miRNAs in CF as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. Finally, we will provide an overview on potential miRNA-based therapeutic approaches.",33348555,PMC7765910,10.3390/diagnostics10121102,,2020,"De Palma FDE, Raia V, Kroemer G, Maiuri MC.",Y,MED
Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated correction of CFTR splicing improves chloride secretion in cystic fibrosis patient-derived bronchial epithelial cells.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, encoding an anion channel that conducts chloride and bicarbonate across epithelial membranes. Mutations that disrupt pre-mRNA splicing occur in >15% of CF cases. One common CFTR splicing mutation is CFTR c.3718-2477C>T (3849+10 kb C>T), which creates a new 5' splice site, resulting in splicing to a cryptic exon with a premature termination codon. Splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) have emerged as an effective therapeutic strategy to block aberrant splicing. We test an ASO targeting the CFTR c.3718-2477C>T mutation and show that it effectively blocks aberrant splicing in primary bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells from CF patients with the mutation. ASO treatment results in long-term improvement in CFTR activity in hBE cells, as demonstrated by a recovery of chloride secretion and apical membrane conductance. We also show that the ASO is more effective at recovering chloride secretion in our assay than ivacaftor, the potentiator treatment currently available to these patients. Our findings demonstrate the utility of ASOs in correcting CFTR expression and channel activity in a manner expected to be therapeutic in patients.",32520327,PMC7367209,10.1093/nar/gkaa490,,2020,"Michaels WE, Bridges RJ, Hastings ML.",Y,MED
Progress in Model Systems of Cystic Fibrosis Mucosal Inflammation to Understand Aberrant Neutrophil Activity.,"In response to recurrent infection in cystic fibrosis (CF), powerful innate immune signals trigger polymorphonuclear neutrophil recruitment into the airway lumen. Exaggerated neutrophil proteolytic activity results in sustained inflammation and scarring of the airways. Consequently, neutrophils and their secretions are reliable clinical biomarkers of lung disease progression. As neutrophils are required to clear infection and yet a direct cause of airway damage, modulating adverse neutrophil activity while preserving their pathogen fighting function remains a key area of CF research. The factors that drive their pathological behavior are still under investigation, especially in early disease when aberrant neutrophil behavior first becomes evident. Here we examine the latest findings of neutrophils in pediatric CF lung disease and proposed mechanisms of their pathogenicity. Highlighted in this review are current and emerging experimental methods for assessing CF mucosal immunity and human neutrophil function in the laboratory.",32318073,PMC7154161,10.3389/fimmu.2020.00595,,2020,"Laucirica DR, Garratt LW, Kicic A.",Y,MED
Effect of apical chloride concentration on the measurement of responses to CFTR modulation in airway epithelia cultured from nasal brushings.,"Introduction: One method for assessing the in vitro response to CFTR-modulating compounds is by analysis of epithelial monolayers in an Ussing chamber, where the apical and basolateral surfaces are isolated and the potential difference, short-circuit current, and transepithelial resistance can be monitored. The effect of a chloride ion gradient across airway epithelia on transepithelial chloride transport and the magnitude of CFTR modulator efficacy were examined.Methods: CFTR-mediated changes in the potential difference and transepithelial currents of primary human nasal epithelial cell cultures were quantified in Ussing chambers with either symmetrical solutions or reduced chloride solutions in the apical chamber. CFTR activity in homozygous F508del CFTR epithelia was rescued by treatment with VX-661, C4/C18, 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) for 24 hr at 37°C or by incubation at 29°C for 48 hr.Results: Imposing a chloride gradient increased CFTR-mediated and CaCC-mediated ion transport. Treatment of F508del CFTR homozygous cells with CFTR modulating compounds increased CFTR activity, which was significantly more evident in the presence of a chloride gradient. This observation was recapitulated with temperature-mediated F508del CFTR correction.Conclusions: Imposing a chloride gradient during Ussing chamber measurements resulted in increased CFTR-mediated ion transport in expanded non-CF and F508del CFTR homozygous epithelia. In F508del CFTR homozygous epithelia, the magnitude of response to CFTR modulating compounds or low temperature was greater when assayed with a chloride gradient compared to symmetrical chloride, resulting in an apparent increase in measured efficacy. Future work may direct which methodologies utilized to quantify CFTR modulator response in vitro are most appropriate for the estimation of in vivo efficacy.",33038073,PMC7547589,10.14814/phy2.14603,,2020,"Bratcher PE, Yadav S, Shaughnessy CA, Thornell IM, Zeitlin PL.",Y,MED

High-Throughput Functional Analysis of CFTR and Other Apically Localized Proteins in iPSC-Derived Human Intestinal Organoids.,"Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) can be differentiated into epithelial organoids that recapitulate the relevant context for CFTR and enable testing of therapies targeting Cystic Fibrosis (CF)-causing mutant proteins. However, to date, CF-iPSC-derived organoids have only been used to study pharmacological modulation of mutant CFTR channel activity and not the activity of other disease-relevant membrane protein constituents. In the current work, we describe a high-throughput, fluorescence-based assay of CFTR channel activity in iPSC-derived intestinal organoids and describe how this method can be adapted to study other apical membrane proteins. Specifically, we show how this assay can be employed to study CFTR and ENaC channels and an electrogenic acid transporter in the same iPSC-derived intestinal tissue. This phenotypic platform promises to expand CF therapy discovery to include strategies that target multiple determinants of epithelial fluid transport.",34943927,PMC8699884,10.3390/cells10123419,,2021,"Xia S, Bozóky Z, Di Paola M, Laselva O, Ahmadi S, Jiang JX, Pitstick AL, Jiang C, Rotin D, Mayhew CN, Jones NL, Bear CE.",Y,MED
Pharmacological Modulation of Ion Channels for the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening monogenic disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, an anion channel that transports chloride and bicarbonate across epithelia. Despite clinical progress in delaying disease progression with symptomatic therapies, these individuals still develop various chronic complications in lungs and other organs, which significantly restricts their life expectancy and quality of life. The development of high-throughput assays to screen drug-like compound libraries have enabled the discovery of highly effective CFTR modulator therapies. These novel therapies target the primary defect underlying CF and are now approved for clinical use for individuals with specific CF genotypes. However, the clinically approved modulators only partially reverse CFTR dysfunction and there is still a considerable number of individuals with CF carrying rare CFTR mutations who remain without any effective CFTR modulator therapy. Accordingly, additional efforts have been pursued to identify novel and more potent CFTR modulators that may benefit a larger CF population. The use of ex vivo individual-derived specimens has also become a powerful tool to evaluate novel drugs and predict their effectiveness in a personalized medicine approach. In addition to CFTR modulators, pro-drugs aiming at modulating alternative ion channels/transporters are under development to compensate for the lack of CFTR function. These therapies may restore normal mucociliary clearance through a mutation-agnostic approach (ie, independent of CFTR mutation) and include inhibitors of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), modulators of the calcium-activated channel transmembrane 16A (TMEM16, or anoctamin 1) or of the solute carrier family 26A member 9 (SLC26A9), and anionophores. The present review focuses on recent progress and challenges for the development of ion channel/transporter-modulating drugs for the treatment of CF.",34326672,PMC8316759,10.2147/jep.s255377,,2021,"Pinto MC, Silva IAL, Figueira MF, Amaral MD, Lopes-Pacheco M.",Y,MED
Functional Profiling of CFTR-Directed Therapeutics Using Pediatric Patient-Derived Nasal Epithelial Cell Models.,"Functional profiling of CFTR-directed therapeutics offers the potential to provide significant benefits to young people with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, the development of 2D airway epithelial cell models for individual response tests in CF children remains a central task. The objective of this study was to determine the utility of EpiXTM technology for expansion of nasal epithelial cells for use in electrophysiological CFTR function measurements. An initial harvest of as few as 20,000 cells was sufficient to expand up to 50 million cells that were used to generate air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures for ion transport studies with the Ussing assay. CFTR function was assessed by measuring responses to forskolin and the CFTR potentiator VX-770 (ivacaftor) in ALI cultures generated from passage 3 and 4 cells. Short-circuit current (Isc) measurements of blocked CFTR currents (ΔICFTRinh) discriminated CFTR function between healthy control (wild type, WT) and patients with intermediate (F508del/R117H-7T: 56% WT) and severe (F508del/F508del: 12% WT) CF disease. For the mixed genotypes, CFTR activity for F508del/c.850dupA was 12% WT, R334W/406-1G>A was 24% WT, and CFTRdele2,3(21 kb)/CFTRdele2,3(21 kb) was 9% WT. The CFTR correctors VX-809 (lumacaftor) and VX-661 (tezacaftor) significantly increased CFTR currents for F508del/R117H to 73 and 67% WT, respectively. Cultures with the large deletion mutation CFTRdele2,3(21 kb) unexpectedly responded to VX-661 treatment (20% WT). Amiloride-sensitive sodium currents were robust and ranged between 20-80 μA/cm2 depending on the subject. In addition to characterizing the electrophysiological profile of mutant CFTR activity in cultures for five genotypes, our study exemplifies the promising paradigm of bed-to-bench side cooperation and personalized medicine.",33014932,PMC7500161,10.3389/fped.2020.00536,,2020,"Park JK, Shrivastava A, Zhang C, Pollok BA, Finkbeiner WE, Gibb ER, Ly NP, Illek B.",Y,MED
Development of orphan drugs for rare diseases.,"Most rare diseases (orphan diseases) still lack approved treatment options despite major advances in research providing the necessary tools to understand their molecular basis and legislation providing regulatory and economic incentives to expedite the development of specific therapies. Addressing this translational gap is a multifaceted challenge, a key aspect of which is the selection of an optimal therapeutic modality to translate advances in rare disease knowledge to potential medicines known as orphan drugs. There are several strategies for developing orphan drugs for rare genetic disorders, including protein replacement therapies, small-molecule therapies (e.g., substrate reduction, chemical chaperone, cofactor, expression modification, and read-through therapies), monoclonal antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNA or exon skipping therapies, gene replacement and direct genome-editing therapies, mRNA therapy, cell therapy, and drug repurposing. Each strategy has its own strengths and limitations in orphan drug development. Furthermore, numerous hurdles are present in clinical trials of rare genetic diseases because of diﬃculty with patient recruitment, unknown molecular physiology, the natural history of the disease, ethical concerns regarding pediatric patients, and regulatory challenges. To address these barriers, the rare genetic diseases community, including academic institutions, industry, patient advocacy groups, foundations, payers, and government regulatory and research organizations, must become engaged in discussions about these issues.",37402468,PMC11222908,10.3345/cep.2023.00535,,2024,Yoo HW.,Y,MED
"Use of a High-Throughput Phenotypic Screening Strategy to Identify Amplifiers, a Novel Pharmacological Class of Small Molecules That Exhibit Functional Synergy with Potentiators and Correctors.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal genetic disorder caused by mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Despite recent groundbreaking approval of genotype-specific small-molecule drugs, a significant portion of CF patients still lack effective therapeutic options that address the underlying cause of the disease. Through a phenotypic high-throughput screen of approximately 54,000 small molecules, we identified a novel class of CFTR modulators called amplifiers. The identified compound, the characteristics of which are represented here by PTI-CH, selectively increases the expression of immature CFTR protein across different CFTR mutations, including F508del-CFTR, by targeting the inefficiencies of early CFTR biosynthesis. PTI-CH also augments the activity of other CFTR modulators and was found to possess novel characteristics that distinguish it from CFTR potentiator and corrector moieties. The PTI-CH-mediated increase in F508del-CFTR did not elicit cytosolic or endoplasmic reticulum-associated cellular stress responses. Based on these data, amplifiers represent a promising new class of CFTR modulators for the treatment of CF that can be used synergistically with other CFTR modulators.",28898585,PMC5784457,10.1177/2472555217729790,,2018,"Giuliano KA, Wachi S, Drew L, Dukovski D, Green O, Bastos C, Cullen MD, Hauck S, Tait BD, Munoz B, Lee PS, Miller JP.",Y,MED
Targeted therapies to improve CFTR function in cystic fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis is the most common genetically determined, life-limiting disorder in populations of European ancestry. The genetic basis of cystic fibrosis is well established to be mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that codes for an apical membrane chloride channel principally expressed by epithelial cells. Conventional approaches to cystic fibrosis care involve a heavy daily burden of supportive treatments to combat lung infection, help clear airway secretions and maintain nutritional status. In 2012, a new era of precision medicine in cystic fibrosis therapeutics began with the licensing of a small molecule, ivacaftor, which successfully targets the underlying defect and improves CFTR function in a subgroup of patients in a genotype-specific manner. Here, we review the three main targeted approaches that have been adopted to improve CFTR function: potentiators, which recover the function of CFTR at the apical surface of epithelial cells that is disrupted in class III and IV genetic mutations; correctors, which improve intracellular processing of CFTR, increasing surface expression, in class II mutations; and production correctors or read-through agents, which promote transcription of CFTR in class I mutations. The further development of such approaches offers great promise for future therapeutic strategies in cystic fibrosis.",26403534,PMC4582929,10.1186/s13073-015-0223-6,,2015,"Brodlie M, Haq IJ, Roberts K, Elborn JS.",Y,MED
Chemically modified hCFTR mRNAs recuperate lung function in a mouse model of cystic fibrosis.,"Gene therapy has always been a promising therapeutic approach for Cystic Fibrosis (CF). However, numerous trials using DNA or viral vectors encoding the correct protein resulted in a general low efficacy. In the last years, chemically modified messenger RNA (cmRNA) has been proven to be a highly potent, pulmonary drug. Consequently, we first explored the expression, function and immunogenicity of human (h)CFTR encoded by cmRNAhCFTR in vitro and ex vivo, quantified the expression by flow cytometry, determined its function using a YFP based assay and checked the immune response in human whole blood. Similarly, we examined the function of cmRNAhCFTR in vivo after intratracheal (i.t.) or intravenous (i.v.) injection of the assembled cmRNAhCFTR together with Chitosan-coated PLGA (poly-D, L-lactide-co-glycolide 75:25 (Resomer RG 752 H)) nanoparticles (NPs) by FlexiVent. The amount of expression of human hCFTR encoded by cmRNAhCFTR was quantified by hCFTR ELISA, and cmRNAhCFTR values were assessed by RT-qPCR. Thereby, we observed a significant improvement of lung function, especially in regards to FEV0.1, suggesting NP-cmRNAhCFTR as promising therapeutic option for CF patients independent of their CFTR genotype.",30425265,PMC6233194,10.1038/s41598-018-34960-0,,2018,"Haque AKMA, Dewerth A, Antony JS, Riethmüller J, Schweizer GR, Weinmann P, Latifi N, Yasar H, Pedemonte N, Sondo E, Weidensee B, Ralhan A, Laval J, Schlegel P, Seitz C, Loretz B, Lehr CM, Handgretinger R, Kormann MSD.",Y,MED
Rescue of Mutant CFTR Trafficking Defect by the Investigational Compound MCG1516A.,"Although some therapeutic progress has been achieved in developing small molecules that correct F508del-CFTR defects, the mechanism of action (MoA) of these compounds remain poorly elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects and MoA of MCG1516A, a newly developed F508del-CFTR corrector. MCG1516A effects on wild-type (WT) and F508del-CFTR were assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy, and biochemical and functional assays both in cell lines and in intestinal organoids. To shed light on the MoA of MCG1516A, we evaluated its additivity to the FDA-approved corrector VX-661, low temperature, genetic revertants of F508del-CFTR (G550E, R1070W, and 4RK), and the traffic-null variant DD/AA. Finally, we explored the ability of MCG1516A to rescue trafficking and function of other CF-causing mutations. We found that MCG1516A rescues F508del-CFTR with additive effects to VX-661. A similar behavior was observed for WT-CFTR. Under low temperature incubation, F508del-CFTR demonstrated an additivity in processing and function with VX-661, but not with MCG1516A. In contrast, both compounds promoted additional effects to low temperature to WT-CFTR. MCG1516A demonstrated additivity to genetic revertant R1070W, while VX-661 was additive to G550E and 4RK. Nevertheless, none of these compounds rescued DD/AA trafficking. Both MCG1516A and VX-661 rescued CFTR processing of L206W- and R334W-CFTR with greater effects when these compounds were combined. In summary, the absence of additivity of MCG1516A to genetic revertant G550E suggests a putative binding site for this compound on NBD1:NBD2 interface. Therefore, a combination of MCG1516A with compounds able to rescue DD/AA traffic, or mimicking the actions of revertant R1070W (e.g., VX-661), could enhance correction of F508del-CFTR defects.",35011698,PMC8750248,10.3390/cells11010136,,2022,"Lopes-Pacheco M, Bacalhau M, Ramalho SS, Silva IAL, Ferreira FC, Carlile GW, Thomas DY, Farinha CM, Hanrahan JW, Amaral MD.",Y,MED
A smartphone application for reporting symptoms in adults with cystic fibrosis: protocol of a randomised controlled trial.,"Introduction: In people with cystic fibrosis (CF), exacerbations have been shown to have profound and prolonged negative effects such as reducing physical activity and health-related quality of life, increasing the rate of decline of lung function and healthcare costs, and ultimately increasing the risk of mortality. Delayed initiation of treatment following the signs of an exacerbation has been shown to be associated with failure to recover to baseline. Therefore, the late identification and treatment of an exacerbation due to delayed presentation will potentially worsen short-term and long-term outcomes. We have developed a smartphone application, containing questions which require yes or no responses relating to symptoms suggestive of a respiratory exacerbation. Its use is intended to facilitate the early identification of symptoms suggestive of a respiratory exacerbation, and allow the CF team to initiate treatment sooner, thereby potentially reducing the risk of severe exacerbations which require intravenous antibiotics (IVAB) and often a hospital admission.Methods: We will undertake a randomised controlled trial. 60 adults with CF will be recruited and randomised to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group will use the smartphone application weekly for 12 months, or earlier than the next weekly reporting time if they feel their symptoms have worsened. The control group will continue to receive usual care, involving regular (approximately 3 monthly) CF outpatient clinic appointments. The primary outcome measure will be courses and days of IVAB.Ethics and dissemination: Approval was obtained from the Sir Charles Gairdner Group Human Research Ethics Committee for WA Health (2015-030) and Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee (HR212/2015), and has been registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.

Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulators in cystic fibrosis: current perspectives.,"Mutations of the *CFTR* gene cause cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common recessive monogenic disease worldwide. These mutations alter the synthesis, processing, function, or half-life of CFTR, the main chloride channel expressed in the apical membrane of epithelial cells in the airway, intestine, pancreas, and reproductive tract. Lung disease is the most critical manifestation of CF. It is characterized by airway obstruction, infection, and inflammation that lead to fatal tissue destruction. In spite of great advances in early and multidisciplinary medical care, and in our understanding of the pathophysiology, CF is still considerably reducing the life expectancy of patients. This review highlights the current development in pharmacological modulators of CFTR, which aim at rescuing the expression and/or function of mutated CFTR.

Matrine in association with FD‑2 stimulates F508del‑cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator activity in the presence of corrector VX809.,"Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, and the predominant mutation is termed Phe508del (F508del). Therapy for F508del‑CFTR patients is based on the use of Orkambi®, a combination of VX809 and VX770. However, though Orkambi leads to an improvement in the lung function of patients, a progressive reduction in its efficacy has been observed. In order to overcome this effect, the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of matrine and the in‑house compound FD‑2 in increasing the action of VX809 and VX770. Fischer rat thyroid cells overexpressing F508del‑CFTR were treated with matrine, VX809 (corrector) and/or with a number of potentiators (VX770, FD‑1 and FD‑2). The results demonstrated that matrine was able to stimulate CFTR activity and, in association with FD‑2, increased the functionality of the channel in the presence of VX809. Based on these results, it may be hypothesized that FD‑2 may be a novel and more effective potentiator compared with VX770.",29039559,PMC5779973,10.3892/mmr.2017.7736,,2017,"Marengo B, Speciale A, Senatore L, Garibaldi S, Musumeci F, Nieddu E, Pollarolo B, Pronzato MA, Schenone S, Mazzei M, Domenicotti C.",Y,MED
CFTR Modulators: Shedding Light on Precision Medicine for Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-threatening monogenic disease aﬄicting Caucasian people. It affects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, glandular and reproductive systems. The major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF is the respiratory disorder caused by a vicious cycle of obstruction of the airways, inflammation and infection that leads to epithelial damage, tissue remodeling and end-stage lung disease. Over the past decades, life expectancy of CF patients has increased due to early diagnosis and improved treatments; however, these patients still present limited quality of life. Many attempts have been made to rescue CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) expression, function and stability, thereby overcoming the molecular basis of CF. Gene and protein variances caused by CFTR mutants lead to different CF phenotypes, which then require different treatments to quell the patients' debilitating symptoms. In order to seek better approaches to treat CF patients and maximize therapeutic effects, CFTR mutants have been stratified into six groups (although several of these mutations present pleiotropic defects). The research with CFTR modulators (read-through agents, correctors, potentiators, stabilizers and amplifiers) has achieved remarkable progress, and these drugs are translating into pharmaceuticals and personalized treatments for CF patients. This review summarizes the main molecular and clinical features of CF, emphasizes the latest clinical trials using CFTR modulators, sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying these new and emerging treatments, and discusses the major breakthroughs and challenges to treating all CF patients.",27656143,PMC5011145,10.3389/fphar.2016.00275,,2016,Lopes-Pacheco M.,Y,MED

Current and Emerging Therapies for the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis or Mitigation of Its Symptoms.,"Clinical presentation of the chronic, heritable condition cystic fibrosis (CF) is complex, with a diverse range of symptoms often affecting multiple organs with varying severity. The primary source of morbidity and mortality is due to progressive destruction of the airways attributable to chronic inflammation arising from microbial colonisation. Antimicrobial therapy combined with practises to remove obstructive mucopurulent deposits form the cornerstone of current therapy. However, new treatment options are emerging which offer, for the first time, the opportunity to effect remission from the underlying cause of CF. Here, we discuss these therapies, their mechanisms of action, and their successes and failures in order to illustrate the shift in the nature of how CF will likely be managed into the future.",26747453,PMC4767716,10.1007/s40268-015-0121-9,,2016,"Murphy MP, Caraher E.",Y,MED

The molecular evolution of function in the CFTR chloride channel.,"The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily includes many proteins of clinical relevance, with genes expressed in all domains of life. Although most members use the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to accomplish the active import or export of various substrates across membranes, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the only known animal ABC transporter that functions primarily as an ion channel. Defects in CFTR, which is closely related to ABCC subfamily members that bear function as bona fide transporters, underlie the lethal genetic disease cystic fibrosis. This article seeks to integrate structural, functional, and genomic data to begin to answer the critical question of how the function of CFTR evolved to exhibit regulated channel activity. We highlight several examples wherein preexisting features in ABCC transporters were functionally leveraged as is, or altered by molecular evolution, to ultimately support channel function. This includes features that may underlie (1) construction of an anionic channel pore from an anionic substrate transport pathway, (2) establishment and tuning of phosphoregulation, and (3) optimization of channel function by specialized ligand-channel interactions. We also discuss how divergence and conservation may help elucidate the pharmacology of important CFTR modulators.",34647973,PMC8640958,10.1085/jgp.202012625,,2021,"Infield DT, Strickland KM, Gaggar A, McCarty NA.",Y,MED

Regulation of CFTR Biogenesis by the Proteostatic Network and Pharmacological Modulators.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal inherited disease among Caucasians in North America and a significant portion of Europe. The disease arises from one of many mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR. The most common disease-associated allele, F508del, along with several other mutations affect the folding, transport, and stability of CFTR as it transits from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane, where it functions primarily as a chloride channel. Early data demonstrated that F508del CFTR is selected for ER associated degradation (ERAD), a pathway in which misfolded proteins are recognized by ER-associated molecular chaperones, ubiquitinated, and delivered to the proteasome for degradation. Later studies showed that F508del CFTR that is rescued from ERAD and folds can alternatively be selected for enhanced endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. A number of other disease-causing mutations in CFTR also undergo these events. Fortunately, pharmacological modulators of CFTR biogenesis can repair CFTR, permitting its folding, escape from ERAD, and function at the cell surface. In this article, we review the many cellular checkpoints that monitor CFTR biogenesis, discuss the emergence of effective treatments for CF, and highlight future areas of research on the proteostatic control of CFTR.",31936842,PMC7013518,10.3390/ijms21020452,,2020,"Estabrooks S, Brodsky JL.",Y,MED
CFTR interactome mapping using the mammalian membrane two-hybrid high-throughput screening system.,"Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) is a chloride and bicarbonate channel in secretory epithelia with a critical role in maintaining fluid homeostasis. Mutations in CFTR are associated with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), the most common lethal autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasians. While remarkable treatment advances have been made recently in the form of modulator drugs directly rescuing CFTR dysfunction, there is still considerable scope for improvement of therapeutic effectiveness. Here, we report the application of a high-throughput screening variant of the Mammalian Membrane Two-Hybrid (MaMTH-HTS) to map the protein-protein interactions of wild-type (wt) and mutant CFTR (F508del), in an effort to better understand CF cellular effects and identify new drug targets for patient-specific treatments.

Acidic Microenvironment Determines Antibiotic Susceptibility and Biofilm Formation of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.,"*Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is the most prevalent bacterial species that contribute to cystic fibrosis (CF) respiratory failure. The impaired function of CF transmembrane conductance regulator leads to abnormal epithelial Cl-/HCO3 - transport and acidification of airway surface liquid. However, it remains unclear why the CF lung is most commonly infected by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* versus other pathogens. We carried out studies to investigate if lower pH helps *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* adapt and thrive in the CF-like acidic lung environment. Our results revealed that *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* generally forms more biofilm, induces antibiotic resistance faster in acidic conditions, and can be reversed by returning the acidic environment to physiologically neutral conditions. *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* appears to be highly adaptive to the CF-like acidic pH environment. By studying the effects of an acidic environment on bacterial response, we may provide a new therapeutic option in preventing chronic *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infection and colonization.",34867864,PMC8640179,10.3389/fmicb.2021.747834,,2021,"Lin Q, Pilewski JM, Di YP.",Y,MED
Airway microbial diversity is decreased in young children with cystic fibrosis compared to healthy controls but improved with CFTR modulation.,"Background: Culture-independent next generation sequencing has identified diverse microbial communities within the cystic fibrosis (CF) airway. The study objective was to test for differences in the upper airway microbiome of children with CF and healthy controls and age-related differences in children with CF.Methods: Oropharyngeal swabs and clinical data were obtained from 25 children with CF and 50 healthy controls aged ≤6 years. Bacterial DNA was amplified and sequenced for the V4 region of 16S rRNA marker-gene. Alpha diversity was measured using operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Shannon diversity, and the inverse Simpson's index. Beta diversity was measured using Morisita-Horn and Bray-Curtis and Jaccard distances. General linear models were used for comparison of alpha diversity measures between groups to account for differences in demographics and exposures. Mixed effects general linear models were used for longitudinal comparisons 1) between children with CF of different ages and 2) between children with CF receiving CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators, children with CF not receiving CFTR modulators, and healthy controls to adjust for repeated measures per subject.Results: Children with CF were more likely to have received antibiotics in the prior year than healthy controls (92% vs 24%, p < 0.001). Controlling age, race, ethnicity, length of breastfeeding, and having siblings, children with CF had a lower richness than healthy controls: OTUs 62.1 vs 83, p = 0.022; and trended toward lower diversity: Shannon 2.09 vs 2.35, p = 0.057; inverse Simpson 5.7 vs 6.92, p = 0.118. *Staphylococcus*, three Rothia OTUs, and two *Streptococcus* OTUs were more abundant in CF children versus healthy controls (all p < 0.05). Bray-Curtis and Jaccard distances, which reflect overall microbial community composition, were also significantly different (both p = 0.001). In longitudinally collected samples from children with CF, Morisita-Horn trended toward more similarity in those aged 0-2 years compared to those aged 3-6 years (p = 0.070). In children >2 years of age, there was a significant trend in increasing alpha diversity measures between children with CF not receiving CFTR modulators, children with CF receiving CFTR modulators, and healthy controls: OTUs 63.7 vs 74.7 vs 97.6, p < 0.001; Shannon 2.11 vs 2.34 vs 2.56, p < 0.001; inverse Simpson 5.78 vs 7.23 vs 7.96, p < 0.001.Conclusions: Children with CF have lower bacterial diversity and different composition of organisms compared with healthy controls. This appears to start in early childhood, is possibly related to the use of antibiotics, and may be partially corrected with the use of CFTR modulators.",32514485,PMC7267737,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04104,,2020,"Hahn A, Burrell A, Ansusinha E, Peng D, Chaney H, Sami I, Perez GF, Koumbourlis AC, McCarter R, Freishtat RJ, Crandall KA, Zemanick ET.",Y,MED
Chronic Lung Pathologies That Require Repair and Regeneration,"Chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary fibrosis, are a major cause of mortality worldwide. With the increasing incidence with ageing, the full impact of these diseases is yet to be realised. For most chronic lung diseases there are limited treatments options, with the existing approaches mainly addressing symptom relief. Little progress has been made, in recent years, in the development of new therapeutic strategies for managing these burdensome pathologies. There is an urgent need to increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these diseases. Endogenous progenitor cells (stem cells) have been recognised in many organs, including the lungs where they are suggested to maintain a population of cells that are able to facilitate the endogenous repair processes. Emerging knowledge of how these repair processes are disrupted in chronic lung diseases and the potential to capitalise upon the regenerative capacity of stem cell populations raise the hopes of the field worldwide for innovative treatment approaches for these devastating diseases in the future. This chapter outlines the series of diseases that may benefit from these emerging new therapeutic outlooks.",,PMC7122311,,,2019,"de Hilster R, Li M, Timens W, Hylkema M, Burgess J.",Y,PMC
Evolving Mechanistic Views and Emerging Therapeutic Strategies for Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes.,"Diabetes is a common and important complication of cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive genetic disease due to mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene. Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is associated with profound detrimental effects on the disease course and mortality and is expected to increase in prevalence as the survival of patients with cystic fibrosis continues to improve. Despite progress in the functional characterization of *CFTR* molecular defects, the mechanistic basis of CFRD is not well understood, in part because of the relative inaccessibility of the pancreatic tissue and the limited availability of representative animal models. This review presents a concise overview of the current understanding of CFRD pathogenesis and provides a cutting-edge update on novel findings from human and animal studies. Potential contributions from paracrine mechanisms and *β*-cell compensatory mechanisms are highlighted, as well as functional *β*-cell and *α*-cell defects, incretin defects, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and loss of islet cell mass.

Primarily described as involved in several cancer and colonic diseases physiopathological mechanisms, the SLC6A14 gene has been more recently identified as a genetic modifier of cystic fibrosis (CF) disease severity. It was indeed shown to have a pleiotropic effect, modulating meconium ileus occurrence, lung disease severity, and precocity of P. aeruginosa airway infection. The biological mechanisms explaining the impact of SLC6A14 on intestinal and lung phenotypes of CF patients are starting to be elucidated.

Increasing the Endoplasmic Reticulum Pool of the F508del Allele of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Leads to Greater Folding Correction by Small Molecule Therapeutics.,"Small molecules that correct the folding defects and enhance surface localization of the F508del mutation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) comprise an important therapeutic strategy for cystic fibrosis lung disease. However, compounds that rescue the F508del mutant protein to wild type (WT) levels have not been identified. In this report, we consider obstacles to obtaining robust and therapeutically relevant levels of F508del CFTR. For example, markedly diminished steady state amounts of F508del CFTR compared to WT CFTR are present in recombinant bronchial epithelial cell lines, even when much higher levels of mutant transcript are present. In human primary airway cells, the paucity of Band B F508del is even more pronounced, although F508del and WT mRNA concentrations are comparable. Therefore, to augment levels of ""repairable"" F508del CFTR and identify small molecules that then correct this pool, we developed compound library screening protocols based on automated protein detection. First, cell-based imaging measurements were used to semi-quantitatively estimate distribution of F508del CFTR by high content analysis of two-dimensional images. We evaluated ~2,000 known bioactive compounds from the NIH Roadmap Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository in a pilot screen and identified agents that increase the F508del protein pool. Second, we analyzed ~10,000 compounds representing diverse chemical scaffolds for effects on total CFTR expression using a multi-plate fluorescence protocol and describe compounds that promote F508del maturation. Together, our findings demonstrate proof of principle that agents identified in this fashion can augment the level of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident ""Band B"" F508del CFTR suitable for pharmacologic correction. As further evidence in support of this strategy, PYR-41-a compound that inhibits the E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme-was shown to synergistically enhance F508del rescue by C18, a small molecule corrector. Our combined results indicate that increasing the levels of ER-localized CFTR available for repair provides a novel route to correct F508del CFTR.",27732613,PMC5061379,10.1371/journal.pone.0163615,,2016,"Chung WJ, Goeckeler-Fried JL, Havasi V, Chiang A, Rowe SM, Plyler ZE, Hong JS, Mazur M, Piazza GA, Keeton AB, White EL, Rasmussen L, Weissman AM, Denny RA, Brodsky JL, Sorscher EJ.",Y,MED
Clinical and genetic characteristics of cystic fibrosis in CHINESE patients: a systemic review of reported cases.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare disease most commonly seen in Caucasians. Only a few Chinese CF patients have been described in literature, taking into account the large population of China. In this systematic review, we collected the clinical and genetic information of 71 Chinese CF patients based on all available data. Compared with Caucasians, Chinese CF patients often present atypical symptoms, mainly displaying symptoms of pulmonary infection with fewer digestive symptoms. An ethnicity-specific CFTR variant spectrum was also observed in CF patients of Chinese origin, with p.Gly970Asp as the most common mutation while p.Phe508del, the most common pathogenic mutation in CF patients of Caucasian origin, is rare, suggesting the necessity of a Chinese-specific CFTR variant screening panel. Besides, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis should be routinely considered, especially for those with unidentified mutations. Potential under-diagnosis of CF in Chinese patients might be caused by a combination of atypical clinical features and genetic heterogeneity in Chinese CF patients, the inaccessibility of sweat and genetic testing facilities, and the one-child policy in China. With the approval of promising small molecule correctors and potentiators, molecular characterization of Chinese-specific CFTR mutations will help to realize more precise treatment for Chinese CF patients.",30558651,PMC6296146,10.1186/s13023-018-0968-2,,2018,"Guo X, Liu K, Liu Y, Situ Y, Tian X, Xu KF, Zhang X.",Y,MED

Two Small Molecules Restore Stability to a Subpopulation of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator with the Predominant Disease-causing Mutation.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations that disrupt the plasma membrane expression, stability, and function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel. Two small molecules, the CFTR corrector lumacaftor and the potentiator ivacaftor, are now used clinically to treat CF, although some studies suggest that they have counteracting effects on CFTR stability. Here, we investigated the impact of these compounds on the instability of F508del-CFTR, the most common CF mutation. To study individual CFTR Cl- channels, we performed single-channel recording, whereas to assess entire CFTR populations, we used purified CFTR proteins and macroscopic CFTR Cl- currents. At 37 °C, low temperature-rescued F508del-CFTR more rapidly lost function in cell-free membrane patches and showed altered channel gating and current flow through open channels. Compared with purified wild-type CFTR, the full-length F508del-CFTR was about 10 °C less thermostable. Lumacaftor partially stabilized purified full-length F508del-CFTR and slightly delayed deactivation of individual F508del-CFTR Cl- channels. By contrast, ivacaftor further destabilized full-length F508del-CFTR and accelerated channel deactivation. Chronic (prolonged) co-incubation of F508del-CFTR-expressing cells with lumacaftor and ivacaftor deactivated macroscopic F508del-CFTR Cl- currents. However, at the single-channel level, chronic co-incubation greatly increased F508del-CFTR channel activity and temporal stability in most, but not all, cell-free membrane patches. We conclude that chronic lumacaftor and ivacaftor co-treatment restores stability in a small subpopulation of F508del-CFTR Cl- channels but that the majority remain destabilized. A fuller understanding of these effects and the characterization of the small F508del-CFTR subpopulation might be crucial for CF therapy development.",28087700,PMC5339754,10.1074/jbc.m116.751537,,2017,"Meng X, Wang Y, Wang X, Wrennall JA, Rimington TL, Li H, Cai Z, Ford RC, Sheppard DN.",Y,MED

In an independent and larger cohort, we aimed to evaluate whether *SLC26A9* variants contribute to the variability of the lung phenotype and if they influence the lung response to ivacaftor. We genotyped the French CF Gene Modifier Study cohort (*n* = 4,840) to investigate whether *SLC26A9* variants were involved in the lung phenotype heterogeneity. Their influence in the response to ivacaftor was tested in the 30 treated patients who met the inclusion criteria: older than 6 years of age, percent-predicted forced expiratory volume measured in 1 s (FEV1pp) in the 3 months before treatment initiation ranging between 40 and 90%. Response to treatment was determined by the change in FEV1pp from baseline, averaged in 15-75 days, and the 1st-year post-treatment. We observed that *SLC26A9* variants were not associated with lung function variability in untreated patients and that gain of lung function in patients treated with ivacaftor was similar to clinical trials. We confirmed that rs7512462 was associated with variability in ivacaftor-lung response, with a significant reduction in lung function improvement for patients with the C allele. Other *SLC26A9* SNPs also contributed to the ivacaftor-response. Interindividual variability in lung response to ivacaftor is associated with *SLC26A9* variants in French CF patients. Pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine will soon be part of CF patient care.",30140228,PMC6095007,10.3389/fphar.2018.00828,,2018,"Corvol H, Mésinèle J, Douksieh IH, Strug LJ, Boëlle PY, Guillot L.",Y,MED
Nanomedicine Approaches for the Pulmonary Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease affecting today nearly 70,000 patients worldwide and characterized by a hypersecretion of thick mucus difficult to clear arising from the defective CFTR protein. The over-production of the mucus secreted in the lungs, along with its altered composition and consistency, results in airway obstruction that makes the lungs susceptible to recurrent and persistent bacterial infections and endobronchial chronic inflammation, which are considered the primary cause of bronchiectasis, respiratory failure, and consequent death of patients. Despite the difficulty of treating the continuous infections caused by pathogens in CF patients, various strategies focused on the symptomatic therapy have been developed during the last few decades, showing significant positive impact on prognosis. Moreover, nowadays, the discovery of CFTR modulators as well as the development of gene therapy have provided new opportunity to treat CF. However, the lack of effective methods for delivery and especially targeted delivery of therapeutics specifically to lung tissues and cells limits the efficiency of the treatments. Nanomedicine represents an extraordinary opportunity for the improvement of current therapies and for the development of innovative treatment options for CF previously considered hard or impossible to treat. Due to the peculiar environment in which the therapies have to operate characterized by several biological barriers (pulmonary tract, mucus, epithelia, bacterial biofilm) the use of nanotechnologies to improve and enhance drug delivery or gene therapies is an extremely promising way to be pursued. The aim of this review is to revise the currently used treatments and to outline the most recent progresses about the use of nanotechnology for the management of CF.",31921811,PMC6927921,10.3389/fbioe.2019.00406,,2019,"Velino C, Carella F, Adamiano A, Sanguinetti M, Vitali A, Catalucci D, Bugli F, Iafisco M.",Y,MED
Strategies for the etiological therapy of cystic fibrosis.,"Etiological therapies aim at repairing the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF), which is the functional defect of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein owing to mutations in the CFTR gene. Among these, the F508del CFTR mutation accounts for more than two thirds of CF cases worldwide. Two somehow antinomic schools of thought conceive CFTR repair in a different manner. According to one vision, drugs should directly target the mutated CFTR protein to increase its plasma membrane expression (correctors) or improve its ion transport function (potentiators). An alternative strategy consists in modulating the cellular environment and proteostasis networks in which the mutated CFTR protein is synthesized, traffics to its final destination, the plasma membrane, and is turned over. We will analyze distinctive advantages and drawbacks of these strategies in terms of their scientific and clinical dimensions, and we will propose a global strategy for CF research and development based on a reconciliatory approach. Moreover, we will discuss the utility of preclinical biomarkers that may guide the personalized, patient-specific implementation of CF therapies.",28937684,PMC5635223,10.1038/cdd.2017.126,,2017,"Maiuri L, Raia V, Kroemer G.",Y,MED
Pathophysiology of Cystic Fibrosis Liver Disease: A Channelopathy Leading to Alterations in Innate Immunity and in Microbiota.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic disease caused by mutation of Cftr. CF-associated liver disease (CFLD) is a common nonpulmonary cause of mortality in CF and accounts for approximately 2.5%-5% of overall CF mortality. The peak of the disease is in the pediatric population, but a second wave of liver disease in CF adults has been reported in the past decade in association with an increase in the life expectancy of these patients. New drugs are available to correct the basic defect in CF but their efficacy in CFLD is not known. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, expressed in the apical membrane of cholangiocytes, is a major determinant for bile secretion and CFLD classically has been considered a channelopathy. However, the recent findings of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator as a regulator of epithelial innate immunity and the possible influence of the intestinal disease with an altered microbiota on the liver complication have opened new mechanistic insights on the pathogenesis of CFLD. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and discusses a potential target for intervention.",31075352,PMC6664222,10.1016/j.jcmgh.2019.04.013,,2019,"Fiorotto R, Strazzabosco M.",Y,MED
Phenotyping of Rare *CFTR* Mutations Reveals Distinct Trafficking and Functional Defects.,"*Background.* The most common *CFTR* mutation, F508del, presents with multiple cellular defects. However, the possible multiple defects caused by many rarer *CFTR* mutations are not well studied. We investigated four rare *CFTR* mutations E60K, G85E, E92K and A455E against well-characterized mutations, F508del and G551D, and their responses to corrector VX-809 and/or potentiator VX-770. *Methods.* Using complementary assays in HEK293T stable cell lines, we determined maturation by Western blotting, trafficking by flow cytometry using extracellular 3HA-tagged CFTR, and function by halide-sensitive YFP quenching. In the forskolin-induced swelling assay in intestinal organoids, we validated the effect of tagged versus endogenous CFTR. *Results.* Treatment with VX-809 significantly restored maturation, PM localization and function of both E60K and E92K. Mechanistically, VX-809 not only raised the total amount of CFTR, but significantly increased the traffic efficiency, which was not the case for A455E. G85E was refractory to VX-809 and VX-770 treatment. *Conclusions.* Since no single model or assay allows deciphering all defects at once, we propose a combination of phenotypic assays to collect rapid and early insights into the multiple defects of CFTR variants.",32204475,PMC7140603,10.3390/cells9030754,,2020,"Ensinck M, De Keersmaecker L, Heylen L, Ramalho AS, Gijsbers R, Farré R, De Boeck K, Christ F, Debyser Z, Carlon MS.",Y,MED
Is cellular senescence involved in cystic fibrosis?,"Pulmonary disease is the main cause of the morbidity and mortality of patients affected by cystic fibrosis (CF). The lung pathology is dominated by excessive recruitment of neutrophils followed by an exaggerated inflammatory process that has also been reported to occur in the absence of apparent pathogenic infections. Airway surface dehydration and mucus accumulation are the driving forces of this process. The continuous release of reactive oxygen species and proteases by neutrophils contributes to tissue damage, which eventually leads to respiratory insufficiency. CF has been considered a paediatric problem for several decades. Nevertheless, during the last 40 years, therapeutic options for CF have been greatly improved, turning CF into a chronic disease and extending the life expectancy of patients. Unfortunately, chronic inflammatory processes, which are characterized by a substantial release of cytokines and chemokines, along with ROS and proteases, can accelerate cellular senescence, leading to further complications in adulthood. The alterations and mechanisms downstream of CFTR functional defects that can stimulate cellular senescence remain unclear. However, while there are correlative data suggesting that cellular senescence may be implicated in CF, a causal or consequential relationship between cellular senescence and CF is still far from being established. Senescence can be both beneficial and detrimental. Senescence may suppress bacterial infections and cooperate with tissue repair. Additionally, it may act as an effective anticancer mechanism. However, it may also promote a pro-inflammatory environment, thereby damaging tissues and leading to chronic age-related diseases. In this review, we present the most current knowledge on cellular senescence and contextualize its possible involvement in CF.",30764828,PMC6376730,10.1186/s12931-019-0993-2,,2019,"Bezzerri V, Piacenza F, Caporelli N, Malavolta M, Provinciali M, Cipolli M.",Y,MED

A novel triple combination of pharmacological chaperones improves F508del-CFTR correction.,"Pharmacological chaperones (e.g. VX-809, lumacaftor) that bind directly to F508del-CFTR and correct its mislocalization are promising therapeutics for Cystic Fibrosis (CF). However to date, individual correctors provide only ~4% improvement in lung function measured as FEV1, suggesting that multiple drugs will be needed to achieve substantial clinical benefit. Here we examine if multiple sites for pharmacological chaperones exist and can be targeted to enhance the rescue of F508del-CFTR with the premise that additive or synergistic rescue by multiple pharmacological chaperones compared to single correctors indicates that they have different sites of action. First, we found that a combination of the pharmacological chaperones VX-809 and RDR1 provide additive correction of F508del-CFTR. Then using cellular thermal stability assays (CETSA) we demonstrated the possibility of a third pharmacologically important site using the novel pharmacological chaperone tool compound 4-methyl-N-[3-(morpholin-4-yl) quinoxalin-2-yl] benzenesulfonamide (MCG1516A). All three pharmacological chaperones appear to interact with the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1). The triple combination of MCG1516A, RDR1, and VX-809 restored CFTR function to >20% that of non-CF cells in well differentiated HBE cells and to much higher levels in other cell types. Thus the results suggest the presence of at least three distinct sites for pharmacological chaperones on F508del-CFTR NBD1, encouraging the development of triple corrector combinations.",30061653,PMC6065411,10.1038/s41598-018-29276-y,,2018,"Carlile GW, Yang Q, Matthes E, Liao J, Radinovic S, Miyamoto C, Robert R, Hanrahan JW, Thomas DY.",Y,MED
Effects of inhaled high-molecular weight hyaluronan in inflammatory airway disease.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is affecting thousands of patients worldwide. Adjuvant anti-inflammatory treatment is an important component of cystic fibrosis treatment, and has shown promise in preserving lung function and prolonging life expectancy. Inhaled high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA) is reported to improve tolerability of hypertonic saline and thus increase compliance, and has been approved in some European countries for use as an adjunct to hypertonic saline treatment in cystic fibrosis. However, there are theoretical concerns that HMW-HA breakdown products may be pro-inflammatory. In this clinical pilot study we show that sputum cytokines in CF patients receiving HMW-HA are not increased, and therefore HMW-HA does not appear to adversely affect inflammatory status in CF airways.",27716205,PMC5048477,10.1186/s12931-016-0442-4,,2016,"Lamas A, Marshburn J, Stober VP, Donaldson SH, Garantziotis S.",Y,MED
First clinical trials of the inhaled epithelial sodium channel inhibitor BI 1265162 in healthy volunteers.,"Background: Inhibition of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) represents a mutation-agnostic therapeutic approach to restore airway surface liquid hydration and mucociliary clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis. BI 1265162 is an inhaled ENaC inhibitor with demonstrated preclinical efficacy.Methods: Three phase I trials of BI 1265162 in healthy male subjects are presented: NCT03349723 (single-rising-dose trial evaluating safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK)); NCT03576144 (multiple-rising-dose trial evaluating safety, tolerability and PK); and NCT03907280 (absolute bioavailability trial).Results: BI 1265162 single doses ≤1200 µg and multiple doses of 600 µg were well tolerated. Adverse events were balanced across treatment groups, were of mainly mild or moderate intensity and resolved by trial-end. One subject discontinued from trial medication on day 7 (asymptomatic hyperkalaemia adverse event; recovered day 8). One subject experienced a serious adverse event (neuropathia vestibularis) leading to hospitalisation and missed one of the four dosing periods. Both events were not considered to be drug-related and subjects recovered. BI 1265162 displayed dose-proportional, time-independent PK; maximum accumulation was 1.6-fold; calculated effective elimination half-life was 3.6-8.7 h over the dose ranges tested. Renal excretion was not a major drug elimination route. Oral and inhaled dosing (±activated oral charcoal) absolute bioavailability was 0.50% and ∼40%, respectively.Conclusion: BI 1265162 single or multiple doses up to 6.5 days were well tolerated. Systemic exposures mainly represent drug absorbed through the lungs and not the gastrointestinal tract, with ∼40% of the inhaled dose reaching the systemic circulation. Accumulation was minimal. Twice-daily dosing is supported for future development.",33569494,PMC7861022,10.1183/23120541.00447-2020,,2021,"Mackie A, Rascher J, Schmid M, Endriss V, Brand T, Seibold W.",Y,MED
C-Reactive Protein in Stable Cystic Fibrosis: An Additional Indicator of Clinical Disease Activity and Risk of Future Pulmonary Exacerbations.,"Introduction: In stable adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, we assessed the role of baseline high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) on CF clinical variables and frequency of intravenous (IV) treated pulmonary exacerbations (PExs) 1-year post-baseline.Methods: We recruited 51 clinically stable CF patients from our Adult CF Center. We incorporated collected parameters into Matouk CF clinical score and CF questionnaire-revised quality of life score (QOL). We used the clinical minus complications subscores as a clinical disease activity score (CDAS). We dichotomized our patients according to the cohort median baseline hs-CRP of 5.2 mg/L.Results: Patients in the high hs-CRP group (≥ 5.2 mg/L) demonstrated worse CDAS (r=0.67, p=0.0001) and QOL scores (r=0.57, p=0.0017) at a given FEV1% predicted. In both hs-CRP groups, prior-year IV-treated PExs and baseline CDASs were significant predictors of future IV-treated PExs. Interestingly, the association between baseline CDAS and future PExs frequency was more robust in the high compared to the low hs-CRP group (r=-0.88, p<0.0001, r=-0.48, p=0.017, respectively) with a steeper regression slope (p=0.001). In addition, a significant interaction was demonstrated between elevated baseline hs-CRP levels and CDASs for the prediction of increased risk of future PExs (p=0.02). This interaction provided an additional indicator of clinical disease activity and added another dimension to the prior year PExs frequency phenotype to identify patients at increased risk for future PExs.Conclusion: Stable CF patients with elevated baseline hs-CRP (≥ 5.2 mg/L) demonstrated worse clinical disease activity and QOL scores at a given level of disease severity (FEV1% predicted). Elevated baseline hs-CRP values combined with clinical disease activity scores are associated with increased risk for future IV-treated PExs even in those with mild clinical disease activity scores.",28066689,PMC5218840,10.4172/2161-105x.1000375,,2016,"Matouk E, Nguyen D, Benedetti A, Bernier J, Gruber J, Landry J, Rousseau S, Ahlgren HG, Lands LC, Wojewodka G, Radzioch D.",Y,MED
Combination of Correctors Rescues CFTR Transmembrane-Domain Mutants by Mitigating their Interactions with Proteostasis.,"Background/aims: Premature degradation of mutated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein causes cystic fibrosis (CF), the commonest Mendelian disease in Caucasians. Despite recent advances in precision medicines for CF patients, many CFTR mutants have not been characterized and the effects of these new therapeutic approaches are still unclear for those mutants.Methods: Cells transfected or stably expressing four CFTR transmembrane-domain mutants (G85E, E92K, L1077P, and M1101K) were used to: 1) characterize the mutants according to their protein expression, thermal sensitivity, and degradation pathways; 2) evaluate the effects of correctors in rescuing them; and 3) explore the effects of correctors on CFTR interactions with proteostasis components.Results: All four mutants exhibited lower protein expression than did wild type-CFTR, and they were degraded by proteasomes and aggresomes. At low temperature, only cells expressing the mutants L1077P and M1101K exhibited increased CFTR maturation. Co-administration of C4 and C18 showed the greatest effect, restoring functional expression and partial stability of CFTR bearing E92K, L1077P, or M1101K at the cell surface. However, this treatment was inefficient in rectifying the defect of CFTR bearing G85E. Correctors rescued CFTR mutants by reducing their interactions with proteostasis components associated with protein retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and ubiquitination.Conclusion: Co-administration of C4 and C18 rescued CFTR transmembrane-domain mutants by remodeling the CFTR interactome.",28448979,PMC7082854,10.1159/000475578,,2017,"Lopes-Pacheco M, Boinot C, Sabirzhanova I, Rapino D, Cebotaru L.",Y,MED
Role of RND Efflux Pumps in Drug Resistance of Cystic Fibrosis Pathogens.,"Drug resistance represents a great concern among people with cystic fibrosis (CF), due to the recurrent and prolonged antibiotic therapy they should often undergo. Among Multi Drug Resistance (MDR) determinants, Resistance-Nodulation-cell Division (RND) efflux pumps have been reported as the main contributors, due to their ability to extrude a wide variety of molecules out of the bacterial cell. In this review, we summarize the principal RND efflux pump families described in CF pathogens, focusing on the main Gram-negative bacterial species (*Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Burkholderia cenocepacia*, *Achromobacter xylosoxidans*, *Stenotrophomonas maltophilia*) for which a predominant role of RND pumps has been associated to MDR phenotypes.",34356783,PMC8300704,10.3390/antibiotics10070863,,2021,"Scoffone VC, Trespidi G, Barbieri G, Irudal S, Perrin E, Buroni S.",Y,MED
Lipid Nanoparticles as Delivery Vehicles for Inhaled Therapeutics.,"Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a powerful non-viral carrier for drug delivery. With the prevalence of respiratory diseases, particularly highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, investigations into applying LNPs to deliver inhaled therapeutics directly to the lungs are underway. The progress in LNP development as well as the recent pre-clinical studies in three main classes of inhaled encapsulated drugs: small molecules, nucleic acids and proteins/peptides will be discussed. The advantages of the pulmonary drug delivery system such as reducing systemic toxicity and enabling higher local drug concentration in the lungs are evaluated together with the challenges and design considerations for improved formulations. This review provides a perspective on the future prospects of LNP-mediated delivery of inhaled therapeutics for respiratory diseases.",36140280,PMC9496059,10.3390/biomedicines10092179,,2022,"Leong EWX, Ge R.",Y,MED
Targeted Activation of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The majority of CFTR mutations result in impaired chloride channel function as only a fraction of the mutated CFTR reaches the plasma membrane. The development of a therapeutic approach that facilitates increased cell-surface expression of CFTR could prove clinically relevant. Here, we evaluate and contrast two molecular approaches to activate CFTR expression. We find that an RNA-guided nuclease null Cas9 (dCas9) fused with a tripartite activator, VP64-p65-Rta can activate endogenous CFTR in cultured human nasal epithelial cells from CF patients. We also find that targeting BGas, a long non-coding RNA involved in transcriptionally modulating CFTR expression with a gapmer, induced both strong knockdown of BGas and concordant activation of CFTR. Notably, the gapmer can be delivered to target cells when generated as electrostatic particles with recombinant HIV-Tat cell penetrating peptide (CPP), when packaged into exosomes, or when loaded into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Treatment of patient-derived human nasal epithelial cells containing F508del with gapmer-CPP, gapmer-exosomes, or LNPs resulted in increased expression and function of CFTR. Collectively, these observations suggest that CRISPR/dCas-VPR (CRISPR) and BGas-gapmer approaches can target and specifically activate CFTR.",31383454,PMC6822231,10.1016/j.ymthe.2019.07.002,,2019,"Villamizar O, Waters SA, Scott T, Saayman S, Grepo N, Urak R, Davis A, Jaffe A, Morris KV.",Y,MED
TGF-β1 Augments the Apical Membrane Abundance of Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2 to Inhibit CFTR-Mediated Chloride Transport in Human Bronchial Epithelia.,"The most common disease-causing mutation in the *Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR)* gene, F508del, leads to cystic fibrosis (CF), by arresting CFTR processing and trafficking to the plasma membrane. The FDA-approved modulators partially restore CFTR function and slow down the progression of CF lung disease by increasing processing and delivery to the plasma membrane and improving activity of F508del-CFTR Cl- channels. However, the modulators do not correct compromised membrane stability of rescued F508del-CFTR. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 is a well-established gene modifier of CF associated with worse lung disease in F508del-homozygous patients, by inhibiting CFTR biogenesis and blocking the functional rescue of F508del-CFTR. Lemur tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) is a transmembrane protein localized at the apical and basolateral membrane domain of human bronchial epithelial cells. Phosphorylation of the apical membrane CFTR by LMTK2 triggers its endocytosis and reduces the abundance of membrane-associated CFTR, impairing the CFTR-mediated Cl- transport. We have previously shown that LMTK2 knockdown improves the pharmacologically rescued F508del-CFTR abundance and function. Thus, reducing the LMTK2 recruitment to the plasma membrane may provide a useful strategy to potentiate the pharmacological rescue of F508del-CFTR. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of LMTK2 recruitment to the apical plasma membrane in polarized CFBE41o- cells. TGF-β1 increased LMTK2 abundance selectively at the apical membrane by accelerating its recycling in Rab11-positive vesicles without affecting LMTK2 mRNA levels, protein biosynthesis, or endocytosis. Our data suggest that controlling TGF-β1 signaling may attenuate recruitment of LMTK2 to the apical membrane thereby improving stability of pharmacologically rescued F508del-CFTR.",32117984,PMC7018669,10.3389/fcell.2020.00058,,2020,"Cruz DF, Mitash N, Farinha CM, Swiatecka-Urban A.",Y,MED
Targeting the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UBA1) improves elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor efficacy towards F508del and rare misfolded CFTR mutants.,"The advent of Trikafta (Kaftrio in Europe) (a triple-combination therapy based on two correctors-elexacaftor/tezacaftor-and the potentiator ivacaftor) has represented a revolution for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) carrying the most common misfolding mutation, F508del-CFTR. This therapy has proved to be of great efficacy in people homozygous for F508del-CFTR and is also useful in individuals with a single F508del allele. Nevertheless, the efficacy of this therapy needs to be improved, especially in light of the extent of its use in patients with rare class II CFTR mutations. Using CFBE41o- cells expressing F508del-CFTR, we provide mechanistic evidence that targeting the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UBA1) by TAK-243, a small molecule in clinical trials for other diseases, boosts the rescue of F508del-CFTR induced by CFTR correctors. Moreover, TAK-243 significantly increases the F508del-CFTR short-circuit current induced by elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in differentiated human primary airway epithelial cells, a gold standard for the pre-clinical evaluation of patients' responsiveness to pharmacological treatments. This new combinatory approach also leads to an improvement in CFTR conductance on cells expressing other rare CF-causing mutations, including N1303K, for which Trikafta is not approved. These findings show that Trikafta therapy can be improved by the addition of a drug targeting the misfolding detection machinery at the beginning of the ubiquitination cascade and may pave the way for an extension of Trikafta to low/non-responding rare misfolded CFTR mutants.",35292885,PMC8924136,10.1007/s00018-022-04215-3,,2022,"Borgo C, D'Amore C, Capurro V, Tomati V, Sondo E, Cresta F, Castellani C, Pedemonte N, Salvi M.",Y,MED
Cystic fibrosis - a multiorgan protein misfolding disease.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a heterogeneous multiorgan disease caused by mutations in the *CFTR* gene leading to misfolding (and other defects) and consequent dysfunction of CFTR protein. The majority of mutations cause a severe CF phenotype, and people with this condition will require a wide variety of medical interventions and therapies throughout their lives to address the symptoms of their condition. CF affects many different organ systems, but the most serious consequence of the disease is degeneration of lung function due to chronic respiratory infection and colonization of the airways with opportunistic microbial pathogens. Improvements in therapeutics, particularly the effective use of antibiotics, have led to significant gradual increases in life expectancy. There remains, however, a continuing need for newer, safer and more effective antimicrobials and mucolytic agents to maintain and improve our ability to combat CF lung infections before other curative approaches which target the root cause of the disease become available.",28031875,PMC5137970,10.4155/fso.15.57,,2015,"Fraser-Pitt D, O'Neil D.",Y,MED
Evaluation of both exonic and intronic variants for effects on RNA splicing allows for accurate assessment of the effectiveness of precision therapies.,"Elucidating the functional consequence of molecular defects underlying genetic diseases enables appropriate design of therapeutic options. Treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) is an exemplar of this paradigm as the development of CFTR modulator therapies has allowed for targeted and effective treatment of individuals harboring specific genetic variants. However, the mechanism of these drugs limits effectiveness to particular classes of variants that allow production of CFTR protein. Thus, assessment of the molecular mechanism of individual variants is imperative for proper assignment of these precision therapies. This is particularly important when considering variants that affect pre-mRNA splicing, thus limiting success of the existing protein-targeted therapies. Variants affecting splicing can occur throughout exons and introns and the complexity of the process of splicing lends itself to a variety of outcomes, both at the RNA and protein levels, further complicating assessment of disease liability and modulator response. To investigate the scope of this challenge, we evaluated splicing and downstream effects of 52 naturally occurring CFTR variants (exonic = 15, intronic = 37). Expression of constructs containing select CFTR intronic sequences and complete CFTR exonic sequences in cell line models allowed for assessment of RNA and protein-level effects on an allele by allele basis. Characterization of primary nasal epithelial cells obtained from individuals harboring splice variants corroborated in vitro data. Notably, we identified exonic variants that result in complete missplicing and thus a lack of modulator response (e.g. c.2908G>A, c.523A>G), as well as intronic variants that respond to modulators due to the presence of residual normally spliced transcript (e.g. c.4242+2T>C, c.3717+40A>G). Overall, our data reveals diverse molecular outcomes amongst both exonic and intronic variants emphasizing the need to delineate RNA, protein, and functional effects of each variant in order to accurately assign precision therapies.",33085659,PMC7605713,10.1371/journal.pgen.1009100,,2020,"Joynt AT, Evans TA, Pellicore MJ, Davis-Marcisak EF, Aksit MA, Eastman AC, Patel SU, Paul KC, Osorio DL, Bowling AD, Cotton CU, Raraigh KS, West NE, Merlo CA, Cutting GR, Sharma N.",Y,MED
Buserelin alleviates chloride transport defect in human cystic fibrosis nasal epithelial cells.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disease in Caucasians caused by mutations in the gene encoding the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) chloride (Cl-) channel regulated by protein kinases, phosphatases, divalent cations and by protein-protein interactions. Among protein-protein interactions, we previously showed that Annexin A5 (AnxA5) binds to CFTR and is involved in the channel localization within membranes and in its Cl- channel function. The deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del) is the most common mutation in CF which leads to an altered protein (F508del-CFTR) folding with a nascent protein retained within the ER and is quickly degraded. We previously showed that AnxA5 binds to F508del-CFTR and that its increased expression due to a Gonadoliberin (GnRH) augments Cl- efflux in cells expressing F508del-CFTR. The aim of the present work was to use the GnRH analog buserelin which is already used in medicine. Human nasal epithelial cells from controls and CF patients (F508del/F508del) were treated with buserelin and we show here that the treatment alleviates Cl- channel defects in CF cells. Using proteomics we highlighted some proteins explaining this result. Finally, we propose that buserelin is a potential new pharmaceutical compound that can be used in CF and that bronchus can be targeted since we show here that they express GnRH-R.",29145426,PMC5690610,10.1371/journal.pone.0187774,,2017,"Calvez ML, Benz N, Huguet F, Saint-Pierre A, Rouillé E, Coraux C, Férec C, Kerbiriou M, Trouvé P.",Y,MED

The road for survival improvement of cystic fibrosis patients in Arab countries.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal, monogenic disorder that affects multiple organ systems of the body. The incidence has been described before in the Middle East to be 1 in 2000 to 1 in 5800 live births, and the median survival was estimated to be from 10 to 20 years of age. The present article attempts to revisit various facets of this disease and specifically highlights the most important lacunae that exist in treating CF.

Measurements of Functional Responses in Human Primary Lung Cells as a Basis for Personalized Therapy for Cystic Fibrosis.,"Background: The best investigational drug to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with the most common CF-causing mutation (F508del) is VX-809 (lumacaftor) which recently succeeded in Phase III clinical trial in combination with ivacaftor. This corrector rescues F508del-CFTR from its abnormal intracellular localization to the cell surface, a traffic defect shared by all Class II CFTR mutants. Our goal here is to test the efficacy of lumacaftor in other Class II mutants in primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells derived from CF patients.Methods: The effect of lumacaftor was investigated in primary HBE cells from non-CF and CF patients with F508del/F508del, A561E/A561E, N1303K/G542X, F508del/G542X and F508del/Y1092X genotypes by measurements of Forskolin plus Genistein-inducible equivalent short-circuit current (Ieq-SC-Fsk + Gen) in perfused open-circuit Ussing chambers. Efficacy of corrector C18 was also assessed on A561E/A561E and F508del/F508del cells.Results: Our data indicate that A561E (when present in both alleles) responds positively to lumacaftor treatment at equivalent efficacy of F508del in primary HBE cells. Similarly, lumacaftor has a positive impact on Y1092X, but not on N1303K. Our data also show that cells with only one copy of F508del-CFTR respond less to VX-809. Moreover, there is great variability in lumacaftor responses among F508del-homozygous cells from different donors. Compound C18 failed to rescue A561E-CFTR but not in F508del-CFTR, thus plausibly it has a different mechanism of action distinct from lumacaftor.Conclusions: CF patients with A561E (and likely also those with Y1029X) can potentially benefit from lumacaftor. Moreover, the methodology used here exemplifies how ex vivo approaches may apply personalized therapies to CF and possibly other respiratory diseases.",26137539,PMC4484512,10.1016/j.ebiom.2014.12.005,,2015,"Awatade NT, Uliyakina I, Farinha CM, Clarke LA, Mendes K, Solé A, Pastor J, Ramos MM, Amaral MD.",Y,MED

Brazilian guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by dysfunction of the CFTR gene. It is a multisystem disease that most often affects White individuals. In recent decades, various advances in the diagnosis and treatment of CF have drastically changed the scenario, resulting in a significant increase in survival and quality of life. In Brazil, the current neonatal screening program for CF has broad coverage, and most of the Brazilian states have referral centers for the follow-up of individuals with the disease. Previously, CF was limited to the pediatric age group. However, an increase in the number of adult CF patients has been observed, because of the greater number of individuals being diagnosed with atypical forms (with milder phenotypic expression) and because of the increase in life expectancy provided by the new treatments. However, there is still great heterogeneity among the different regions of Brazil in terms of the access of CF patients to diagnostic and therapeutic methods. The objective of these guidelines was to aggregate the main scientific evidence to guide the management of these patients. A group of 18 CF specialists devised 82 relevant clinical questions, divided into five categories: characteristics of a referral center; diagnosis; treatment of respiratory disease; gastrointestinal and nutritional treatment; and other aspects. Various professionals working in the area of CF in Brazil were invited to answer the questions devised by the coordinators. We used the PubMed database to search the available literature based on keywords, in order to find the best answers to these questions. RESUMO A fibrose cística (FC) é uma doença genética autossômica recessiva caracterizada pela disfunção do gene CFTR. Trata-se de uma doença multissistêmica que ocorre mais frequentemente em populações descendentes de caucasianos. Nas últimas décadas, diversos avanços no diagnóstico e tratamento da FC mudaram drasticamente o cenário dessa doença, com aumento expressivo da sobrevida e qualidade de vida. Atualmente, o Brasil dispõe de um programa de ampla cobertura para a triagem neonatal de FC e centros de referência distribuídos na maior parte desses estados para seguimento dos indivíduos. Antigamente confinada à faixa etária pediátrica, tem-se observado um aumento de pacientes adultos com FC tanto pelo maior número de diagnósticos de formas atípicas, de expressão fenotípica mais leve, assim como pelo aumento da expectativa de vida com os novos tratamentos. Entretanto, ainda se observa uma grande heterogeneidade no acesso aos métodos diagnósticos e terapêuticos para FC entre as diferentes regiões brasileiras. O objetivo dessas diretrizes foi reunir as principais evidências científicas que norteiam o manejo desses pacientes. Um grupo de 18 especialistas em FC elaborou 82 perguntas clínicas relevantes que foram divididas em cinco categorias: características de um centro de referência; diagnóstico; tratamento da doença respiratória; tratamento gastrointestinal e nutricional; e outros aspectos. Diversos profissionais brasileiros atuantes na área da FC foram convidados a responder as perguntas formuladas pelos coordenadores.

Gene therapy-emulating small molecule treatments in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells and patients.,"Background: Several small molecule corrector and potentiator drugs have recently been licensed for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) therapy. However, other aspects of the disease, especially inflammation, are less effectively treated by these drugs. We hypothesized that small molecule drugs could function either alone or as an adjuvant to licensed therapies to treat these aspects of the disease, perhaps emulating the effects of gene therapy in CF cells. The cardiac glycoside digitoxin, which has been shown to inhibit TNFα/NFκB signaling in CF lung epithelial cells, may serve as such a therapy.Methods: IB3-1 CF lung epithelial cells were treated with different Vertex (VX) drugs, digitoxin, and various drug mixtures, and ELISA assays were used to assess suppression of baseline and TNFα-activated secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Transcriptional responses to these drugs were assessed by RNA-seq and compared with gene expression in AAV-[wildtype]CFTR-treated IB3-1 (S9) cells. We also compared in vitro gene expression signatures with in vivo data from biopsied nasal epithelial cells from digitoxin-treated CF patients.Results: CF cells exposed to digitoxin exhibited significant suppression of both TNFα/NFκB signaling and downstream secretion of IL-8, IL-6 and GM-CSF, with or without co-treatment with VX drugs. No evidence of drug-drug interference was observed. RNA-seq analysis showed that gene therapy-treated CF lung cells induced changes in 3134 genes. Among these, 32.6% were altered by digitoxin treatment in the same direction. Shared functional gene ontology themes for genes suppressed by both digitoxin and gene therapy included inflammation (84 gene signature), and cell-cell interactions and fibrosis (49 gene signature), while genes elevated by both were enriched for epithelial differentiation (82 gene signature). A new analysis of mRNA data from digitoxin-treated CF patients showed consistent trends in expression for genes in these signatures.Conclusions: Adjuvant gene therapy-emulating activities of digitoxin may contribute to enhancing the efficacy of currently licensed correctors and potentiators in CF patients.",31864360,PMC6925517,10.1186/s12931-019-1214-8,,2019,"Yang Q, Soltis AR, Sukumar G, Zhang X, Caohuy H, Freedy J, Dalgard CL, Wilkerson MD, Pollard HB, Pollard BS.",Y,MED
"Cystic Fibrosis Treatment: A Paradigm for New Pediatric Medicines, Globalization of Drug Development and the Role of the European Medicines Agency.","The European Pediatric Pharmaceutical Legislation wants children to benefit more from pharmaceutical progress. In rare diseases, concerns have been raised that this legislation might damage research and stymie drug development. We discuss the role of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and its Pediatric Committee (PDCO) in the development of ivacaftor, first-in-class for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with the G551D mutation (and eight other mutations later) and of lumacaftor and ataluren, two more potential break-through CF medications. Ivacaftor was USA-approved early 2012 and six months later in the EU. Registration was based on the same data. We analyzed these drugs' EU pediatric investigation plans (PIPs) and compared the PIP-studies with the pediatric CF studies listed in www.clinicaltrials.gov. The ivacaftor PIP studies appear to reflect what the developer planned anyway, apart from a study in 1-23-month-olds, which has not yet started. The total negotiation time for the current PIP version was approximately 5.5 years. For companies that develop drugs in pediatric diseases, e.g., CF, PIPs represent considerable additional procedural workload with minimal or no additional benefit for the patients. New drugs for pediatric diseases should not be hampered by additional, unnecessary and costly bureaucracy, but be registered as rapidly as possible without compromising safety.",27417354,PMC4928746,10.3390/children2010108,,2015,"Rose K, Spigarelli MG.",Y,MED
Advancing clinical development pathways for new CFTR modulators in cystic fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening genetic disease affecting approximately 70,000 individuals worldwide. Until recently, drug development efforts have emphasised therapies treating downstream signs and symptoms resulting from the underlying CF biological defect: reduced function of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The current CF drug development landscape has expanded to include therapies that enhance CFTR function by either restoring wild-type CFTR protein expression or increasing (modulating) the function of mutant CFTR proteins in cells. To date, two systemic small-molecule CFTR modulators have been evaluated in pivotal clinical trials in individuals with CF and specific mutant CFTR genotypes that have led to regulatory review and/or approval. Advances in the discovery of CFTR modulators as a promising new class of therapies have been impressive, yet work remains to develop highly effective, disease-modifying modulators for individuals of all CF genotypes. The objectives of this review are to outline the challenges and opportunities in drug development created by systemic genotype-specific CFTR modulators, highlight the advantages of sweat chloride as an established biomarker of CFTR activity to streamline early-phase development and summarise options for later phase clinical trial designs that respond to the adoption of approved genotype-specific modulators into standard of care. An optimal development framework will be needed to move the most promising therapies efficiently through the drug development pipeline and ultimately deliver efficacious and safe therapies to all individuals with CF.",26903594,PMC4853537,10.1136/thoraxjnl-2015-208123,,2016,"Mayer-Hamblett N, Boyle M, VanDevanter D.",Y,MED
Synthesis and Therapeutic Applications of Iminosugars in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Iminosugars are sugar analogues endowed with a high pharmacological potential. The wide range of biological activities exhibited by these glycomimetics associated with their excellent drug profile make them attractive therapeutic candidates for several medical interventions. The ability of iminosugars to act as inhibitors or enhancers of carbohydrate-processing enzymes suggests their potential use as therapeutics for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). Herein we review the most relevant advances in the field, paying attention to both the chemical synthesis of the iminosugars and their biological evaluations, resulting from in vitro and in vivo assays. Starting from the example of the marketed drug NBDNJ (*N*-butyl deoxynojirimycin), a variety of iminosugars have exhibited the capacity to rescue the trafficking of F508del-CFTR (deletion of F508 residue in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator), either alone or in combination with other correctors. Interesting results have also been obtained when iminosugars were considered as anti-inflammatory agents in CF lung disease. The data herein reported demonstrate that iminosugars hold considerable potential to be applied for both therapeutic purposes.",32397443,PMC7247015,10.3390/ijms21093353,,2020,"Esposito A, D'Alonzo D, Fenza M, Gregorio E, Tamanini A, Lippi G, Dechecchi MC, Guaragna A.",Y,MED
Recent applications and strategies in nanotechnology for lung diseases.,"Lung diseases, including COVID-19 and lung cancers, is a huge threat to human health. However, for the treatment and diagnosis of various lung diseases, such as pneumonia, asthma, cancer, and pulmonary tuberculosis, are becoming increasingly challenging. Currently, several types of treatments and/or diagnostic methods are used to treat lung diseases; however, the occurrence of adverse reactions to chemotherapy, drug-resistant bacteria, side effects that can be significantly toxic, and poor drug delivery necessitates the development of more promising treatments. Nanotechnology, as an emerging technology, has been extensively studied in medicine. Several studies have shown that nano-delivery systems can significantly enhance the targeting of drug delivery. When compared to traditional delivery methods, several nanoparticle delivery strategies are used to improve the detection methods and drug treatment efficacy. Transporting nanoparticles to the lungs, loading appropriate therapeutic drugs, and the incorporation of intelligent functions to overcome various lung barriers have broad prospects as they can aid in locating target tissues and can enhance the therapeutic effect while minimizing systemic side effects. In addition, as a new and highly contagious respiratory infection disease, COVID-19 is spreading worldwide. However, there is no specific drug for COVID-19. Clinical trials are being conducted in several countries to develop antiviral drugs or vaccines. In recent years, nanotechnology has provided a feasible platform for improving the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, nanotechnology-based strategies may have broad prospects in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. This article reviews the latest developments in nanotechnology drug delivery strategies in the lungs in recent years and studies the clinical application value of nanomedicine in the drug delivery strategy pertaining to the lung.",33456721,PMC7796694,10.1007/s12274-020-3180-3,,2021,"Zhong W, Zhang X, Zeng Y, Lin D, Wu J.",Y,MED
Optimizations of In Vitro Mucus and Cell Culture Models to Better Predict In Vivo Gene Transfer in Pathological Lung Respiratory Airways: Cystic Fibrosis as an Example.,"The respiratory epithelium can be affected by many diseases that could be treated using aerosol gene therapy. Among these, cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal inherited disease characterized by airways complications, which determine the life expectancy and the effectiveness of aerosolized treatments. Beside evaluations performed under in vivo settings, cell culture models mimicking in vivo pathophysiological conditions can provide complementary insights into the potential of gene transfer strategies. Such models must consider multiple parameters, following the rationale that proper gene transfer evaluations depend on whether they are performed under experimental conditions close to pathophysiological settings. In addition, the mucus layer, which covers the epithelial cells, constitutes a physical barrier for gene delivery, especially in diseases such as CF. Artificial mucus models featuring physical and biological properties similar to CF mucus allow determining the ability of gene transfer systems to effectively reach the underlying epithelium. In this review, we describe mucus and cellular models relevant for CF aerosol gene therapy, with a particular emphasis on mucus rheology. We strongly believe that combining multiple pathophysiological features in single complex cell culture models could help bridge the gaps between in vitro and in vivo settings, as well as viral and non-viral gene delivery strategies.",33396283,PMC7823756,10.3390/pharmaceutics13010047,,2020,"Ghanem R, Laurent V, Roquefort P, Haute T, Ramel S, Le Gall T, Aubry T, Montier T.",Y,MED
Cystic fibrosis gene modifier SLC26A9 modulates airway response to CFTR-directed therapeutics.,"Cystic fibrosis is realizing the promise of personalized medicine. Recent advances in drug development that target the causal CFTR directly result in lung function improvement, but variability in response is demanding better prediction of outcomes to improve management decisions. The genetic modifier SLC26A9 contributes to disease severity in the CF pancreas and intestine at birth and here we assess its relationship with disease severity and therapeutic response in the airways. SLC26A9 association with lung disease was assessed in individuals from the Canadian and French CF Gene Modifier consortia with CFTR-gating mutations and in those homozygous for the common Phe508del mutation. Variability in response to a CFTR-directed therapy attributed to SLC26A9 genotype was assessed in Canadian patients with gating mutations. A primary airway model system determined if SLC26A9 shows modification of Phe508del CFTR function upon treatment with a CFTR corrector. In those with gating mutations that retain cell surface-localized CFTR we show that SLC26A9 modifies lung function while this is not the case in individuals homozygous for Phe508del where cell surface expression is lacking. Treatment response to ivacaftor, which aims to improve CFTR-channel opening probability in patients with gating mutations, shows substantial variability in response, 28% of which can be explained by rs7512462 in SLC26A9 (P = 0.0006). When homozygous Phe508del primary bronchial cells are treated to restore surface CFTR, SLC26A9 likewise modifies treatment response (P = 0.02). Our findings indicate that SLC26A9 airway modification requires CFTR at the cell surface, and that a common variant in SLC26A9 may predict response to CFTR-directed therapeutics.",28171547,PMC5886039,10.1093/hmg/ddw290,,2016,"Strug LJ, Gonska T, He G, Keenan K, Ip W, Boëlle PY, Lin F, Panjwani N, Gong J, Li W, Soave D, Xiao B, Tullis E, Rabin H, Parkins MD, Price A, Zuberbuhler PC, Corvol H, Ratjen F, Sun L, Bear CE, Rommens JM.",Y,MED
Vasculitis in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal-recessive multi-organ disease characterized by airways obstruction, recurrent infections, and systemic inflammation. Vasculitis is a severe complication of CF that affects 2-3% of CF patients and is generally associated with poor prognosis. Various pathogenic mechanisms may be involved in the development of CF-related vasculitis. Bacterial colonization leads to persistent activation of neutrophilic granulocytes, inflammation and damage, contributing to the production of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCAs). The presence of ANCA may on the other hand predispose to bacterial colonization and infection, likely entertaining a vicious circle amplifying inflammation and damage. As a result, in CF-associated vasculitis, ongoing inflammation, immune cell activation, the presence of pathogens, and the use of numerous medications may lead to immune complex formation and deposition, subsequently causing leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Published individual case reports and small case series suggest that patients with CF-associated vasculitis require immune modulating treatment, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, and/or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). As immunosuppression increases the risk of infection and/or malignancy, which are both already increased in people with CF, possible alternative medications may involve the blockade of individual cytokine or inflammatory pathways, or the use of novel CFTR modulators. This review summarizes molecular alterations involved in CF-associated vasculitis, clinical presentation, and complications, as well as currently available and future treatment options.",33282799,PMC7690646,10.3389/fped.2020.585275,,2020,"Sposito F, McNamara PS, Hedrich CM.",Y,MED

Galactosemia: Towards Pharmacological Chaperones.,"Galactosemia is a rare inherited metabolic disease resulting from mutations in the four genes which encode enzymes involved in the metabolism of galactose. The current therapy, the removal of galactose from the diet, is inadequate. Consequently, many patients suffer lifelong physical and cognitive disability. The phenotype varies from almost asymptomatic to life-threatening disability. The fundamental biochemical cause of the disease is a decrease in enzymatic activity due to failure of the affected protein to fold and/or function correctly. Many novel therapies have been proposed for the treatment of galactosemia. Often, these are designed to treat the symptoms and not the fundamental cause. Pharmacological chaperones (PC) (small molecules which correct the folding of misfolded proteins) represent an exciting potential therapy for galactosemia. In theory, they would restore enzyme function, thus preventing downstream pathological consequences. In practice, no PCs have been identified for potential application in galactosemia. Here, we review the biochemical basis of the disease, identify opportunities for the application of PCs and describe how these might be discovered. We will conclude by considering some of the clinical issues which will affect the future use of PCs in the treatment of galactosemia.",33562227,PMC7914515,10.3390/jpm11020106,,2021,"Banford S, McCorvie TJ, Pey AL, Timson DJ.",Y,MED

There is also strong evidence of widespread under-diagnosis due to the complexity and lack of standardization of diagnostic criteria. Treatment has long focused on downregulation of the inflammatory response with prolonged courses of oral glucocorticosteroids, but more recently concerns with steroid toxicity and availability of new treatment modalities has led to trials of oral azoles, inhaled amphotericin, pulse intravenous steroids, and subcutaneously-injected anti-IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab, all of which show evidence of efficacy and reduced toxicity.",29376934,PMC5753079,10.3390/jof2020017,,2016,"Tracy MC, Okorie CUA, Foley EA, Moss RB.",Y,MED
The Role of Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators in Cystic Fibrosis Airways Disease.,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a recessive genetic disease due to mutations of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (*CFTR*) gene encoding the CFTR chloride channel. The ion transport abnormalities related to *CFTR* mutation generate a dehydrated airway surface liquid (ASL) layer, which is responsible for an altered mucociliary clearance, favors infections and persistent inflammation that lead to progressive lung destruction and respiratory failure. The inflammatory response is normally followed by an active resolution phase to return to tissue homeostasis, which involves specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). SPMs promote resolution of inflammation, clearance of microbes, tissue regeneration and reduce pain, but do not evoke unwanted immunosuppression. The airways of CF patients showed a decreased production of SPMs even in the absence of pathogens. SPMs levels in the airway correlated with CF patients' lung function. The prognosis for CF has greatly improved but there remains a critical need for more effective treatments that prevent excessive inflammation, lung damage, and declining pulmonary function for all CF patients. This review aims to highlight the recent understanding of CF airway inflammation and the possible impact of SPMs on functions that are altered in CF airways.",32982730,PMC7493015,10.3389/fphar.2020.01290,,2020,"Briottet M, Shum M, Urbach V.",Y,MED
CFTR-NHERF2-LPA₂ Complex in the Airway and Gut Epithelia.,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP- and cGMP-regulated chloride (Cl-) and bicarbonate (HCO₃-) channel localized primarily at the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells lining the airway, gut and exocrine glands, where it is responsible for transepithelial salt and water transport. Several human diseases are associated with altered CFTR channel function. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by the absence or dysfunction of CFTR channel activity, resulting from mutations in the gene. Secretory diarrhea is caused by the hyperactivation of CFTR channel activity in the gastrointestinal tract. CFTR is a validated target for drug development to treat CF, and extensive research has been conducted to develop CFTR inhibitors for therapeutic interventions of secretory diarrhea. The intracellular processing, trafficking, apical membrane localization, and channel function of CFTR are regulated by dynamic protein-protein interactions in a complex network. In this paper, we review the current knowledge of a macromolecular complex of CFTR, Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2), and lysophosphatidic acids (LPA) receptor 2 (LPA₂) at the apical plasma membrane of airway and gut epithelial cells, and discuss its relevance in human physiology and diseases. We also explore the possibilities of targeting this complex to fine tune CFTR channel activity, with a hope to open up new avenues to develop novel therapies for CF and secretory diarrhea.",28869532,PMC5618545,10.3390/ijms18091896,,2017,"Zhang W, Zhang Z, Zhang Y, Naren AP.",Y,MED
Short-term consequences of F508del-CFTR thermal instability on CFTR-dependent transepithelial currents in human airway epithelial cells.,"Loss-of-function mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) channel in human airway epithelial cells are responsible for Cystic Fibrosis. A deleterious impact of physiological temperature on CFTR plasma membrane expression, residence and channel activity is characteristic of the most common and severe CF mutation, F508del. Using primary human F508del-airway epithelial cells and CF bronchial epithelial CFBE41o- cell lines expressing F508del- or WT-CFTR, we examined the effects of temperature (29 °C-39 °C) on the amplitude and stability of short-circuit CFTR-dependent currents over time and the efficiency of pharmacological strategies to stably restore F508del-CFTR function. We show that F508del-CFTR functional instability at 37 °C is not prevented by low temperature or VX-809 correction, genistein and VX-770 potentiators, nor by the combination VX-809/VX-770. Moreover, F508del-CFTR-dependent currents 30 minutes after CFTR activation at 37 °C did not significantly differ whether a potentiator was used or not. We demonstrate that F508del-CFTR function loss is aggravated at temperatures above 37 °C while limited by a small decrease of temperature and show that the more F508del-CFTR is stimulated, the faster the current loss happens. Our study highlights the existence of a temperature-dependent process inhibiting the function of F508del-CFTR, possibly explaining the low efficacy of pharmacological drugs in clinic.",31551433,PMC6760155,10.1038/s41598-019-50066-7,,2019,"Froux L, Coraux C, Sage E, Becq F.",Y,MED
Assembly and Functional Analysis of an S/MAR Based Episome with the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Gene.,"Improving the efficacy of gene therapy vectors is still an important goal toward the development of safe and efficient gene therapy treatments. S/MAR (scaffold/matrix attached region)-based vectors are maintained extra-chromosomally in numerous cell types, which is similar to viral-based vectors. Additionally, when established as an episome, they show a very high mitotic stability. In the present study we tested the idea that addition of an S/MAR element to a CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) expression vector, may allow the establishment of a CFTR episome in bronchial epithelial cells. Starting from the observation that the S/MAR vector pEPI-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescence protein) is maintained as an episome in human bronchial epithelial cells, we assembled the CFTR vector pBQ-S/MAR. This vector, transfected in bronchial epithelial cells with mutated *CFTR*, supported long term wt *CFTR* expression and activity, which in turn positively impacted on the assembly of tight junctions in polarized epithelial cells. Additionally, the recovery of intact pBQ-S/MAR, but not the parental vector lacking the S/MAR element, from transfected cells after extensive proliferation, strongly suggested that pBQ-S/MAR was established as an episome. These results add a new element, the S/MAR, that can be considered to improve the persistence and safety of gene therapy vectors for cystic fibrosis pulmonary disease.",29673202,PMC5979583,10.3390/ijms19041220,,2018,"De Rocco D, Pompili B, Castellani S, Morini E, Cavinato L, Cimino G, Mariggiò MA, Guarnieri S, Conese M, Del Porto P, Ascenzioni F.",Y,MED
Pathophysiology of Lung Disease and Wound Repair in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, life-threatening condition affecting many organs and tissues, the lung disease being the chief cause of morbidity and mortality. Mutations affecting the *CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator* (*CFTR*) gene determine the expression of a dysfunctional protein that, in turn, triggers a pathophysiological cascade, leading to airway epithelium injury and remodeling. In vitro and in vivo studies point to a dysregulated regeneration and wound repair in CF airways, to be traced back to epithelial CFTR lack/dysfunction. Subsequent altered ion/fluid fluxes and/or signaling result in reduced cell migration and proliferation. Furthermore, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition appears to be partially triggered in CF, contributing to wound closure alteration. Finally, we pose our attention to diverse approaches to tackle this defect, discussing the therapeutic role of protease inhibitors, CFTR modulators and mesenchymal stem cells. Although the pathophysiology of wound repair in CF has been disclosed in some mechanisms, further studies are warranted to understand the cellular and molecular events in more details and to better address therapeutic interventions.",35366275,PMC8830450,10.3390/pathophysiology28010011,,2021,"Conese M, Di Gioia S.",Y,MED
Progress in the management of acute colchicine poisoning in adults.,"Colchicine is a tricyclic, lipid-soluble alkaloid which has long been used to treat gout and many immunological diseases. Due to its narrow therapeutic window and long half-life of elimination, colchicine overdose occurs occasionally. Unfortunately, some patients lost their lives because of colchicine overdose or suicide. Acute colchicine poisoning can lead to original gastrointestinal disorders, shock, progressive multiple organ failure, and myelosuppression. Although many researchers in the world performed lots of research, there are currently no specific antidotes for colchicine poisoning. Meanwhile, there are no management guidelines to treat patients with acute colchicine poisoning until now. Herein, we systematically elaborate on the clinical features and progress in the management of acute colchicine poisoning in adults according to the previous literature. This paper will provide some valuable and available information for clinicians.",36028733,PMC9417090,10.1007/s11739-022-03079-6,,2022,"Wu J, Liu Z.",Y,MED
Islet-intrinsic effects of CFTR mutation.,"Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is the most significant extra-pulmonary comorbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, and accelerates lung decline. In addition to the traditional view that CFRD is a consequence of fibrotic destruction of the pancreas as a whole, emerging evidence may implicate a role for cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator (CFTR) in the regulation of insulin secretion from the pancreatic islet. Impaired first-phase insulin responses and glucose homeostasis have also been reported in CF patients. CFTR expression in both human and mouse beta cells has been confirmed, and recent studies have shown differences in endocrine pancreatic morphology from birth in CF. Recent experimental evidence suggests that functional CFTR channels are required for insulin exocytosis and the regulation of membrane potential in the pancreatic beta cell, which may account for the impairments in insulin secretion observed in many CF patients. These novel insights suggest that the pathogenesis of CFRD is more complicated than originally thought, with implications for diabetes treatment and screening in the CF population. This review summarises recent emerging evidence in support of a primary role for endocrine pancreatic dysfunction in the development of CFRD. Summary • CF is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene • The vast majority of morbidity and mortality in CF results from lung disease. However CFRD is the largest extra-pulmonary co-morbidity and rapidly accelerates lung decline • Recent experimental evidence shows that functional CFTR channels are required for normal patterns of first phase insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cell • Current clinical recommendations suggest that insulin is more effective than oral glucose-lowering drugs for the treatment of CFRD. However, the emergence of CFTR corrector and potentiator drugs may offer a personalised approach to treating diabetes in the CF population.",27033560,PMC4901107,10.1007/s00125-016-3936-1,,2016,"Koivula FNM, McClenaghan NH, Harper AGS, Kelly C.",Y,MED

Intravenous phage treatment was well tolerated and associated with objective clinical improvement, including sternal wound closure, improved liver function, and substantial resolution of infected skin nodules.",31068712,PMC6557439,10.1038/s41591-019-0437-z,,2019,"Dedrick RM, Guerrero-Bustamante CA, Garlena RA, Russell DA, Ford K, Harris K, Gilmour KC, Soothill J, Jacobs-Sera D, Schooley RT, Hatfull GF, Spencer H.",Y,MED
Targeting the Heme Oxygenase 1/Carbon Monoxide Pathway to Resolve Lung Hyper-Inflammation and Restore a Regulated Immune Response in Cystic Fibrosis.,"In individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), lung hyper-inflammation starts early in life and is perpetuated by mucus obstruction and persistent bacterial infections. The continuous tissue damage and scarring caused by non-resolving inflammation leads to bronchiectasis and, ultimately, respiratory failure. Macrophages (MΦs) are key regulators of immune response and host defense. We and others have shown that, in CF, MΦs are hyper-inflammatory and exhibit reduced bactericidal activity. Thus, MΦs contribute to the inability of CF lung tissues to control the inflammatory response or restore tissue homeostasis. The non-resolving hyper-inflammation in CF lungs is attributed to an impairment of several signaling pathways associated with resolution of the inflammatory response, including the heme oxygenase-1/carbon monoxide (HO-1/CO) pathway. HO-1 is an enzyme that degrades heme groups, leading to the production of potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and bactericidal mediators, such as biliverdin, bilirubin, and CO. This pathway is fundamental to re-establishing cellular homeostasis in response to various insults, such as oxidative stress and infection. Monocytes/MΦs rely on abundant induction of the HO-1/CO pathway for a controlled immune response and for potent bactericidal activity. Here, we discuss studies showing that blunted HO-1 activation in CF-affected cells contributes to hyper-inflammation and defective host defense against bacteria. We dissect potential cellular mechanisms that may lead to decreased HO-1 induction in CF cells. We review literature suggesting that induction of HO-1 may be beneficial for the treatment of CF lung disease. Finally, we discuss recent studies highlighting how endogenous HO-1 can be induced by administration of controlled doses of CO to reduce lung hyper-inflammation, oxidative stress, bacterial infection, and dysfunctional ion transport, which are all hallmarks of CF lung disease.",32760278,PMC7372134,10.3389/fphar.2020.01059,,2020,"Di Pietro C, Öz HH, Murray TS, Bruscia EM.",Y,MED
Cystic fibrosis lung environment and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.,"Background: The airways of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are highly complex, subject to various environmental conditions as well as a distinct microbiota. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is recognized as one of the most important pulmonary pathogens and the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. A multifarious interplay between the host, pathogens, microbiota, and the environment shapes the course of the disease. There have been several excellent reviews detailing CF pathology, Pseudomonas and the role of environment in CF but only a few reviews connect these entities with regards to influence on the overall course of the disease. A holistic understanding of contributing factors is pertinent to inform new research and therapeutics.Discussion: In this article, we discuss the deterministic alterations in lung physiology as a result of CF. We also revisit the impact of those changes on the microbiota, with special emphasis on P. aeruginosa and the influence of other non-genetic factors on CF. Substantial past and current research on various genetic and non-genetic aspects of cystic fibrosis has been reviewed to assess the effect of different factors on CF pulmonary infection. A thorough review of contributing factors in CF and the alterations in lung physiology indicate that CF lung infection is multi-factorial with no isolated cause that should be solely targeted to control disease progression. A combinatorial approach may be required to ensure better disease outcomes.Conclusion: CF lung infection is a complex disease and requires a broad multidisciplinary approach to improve CF disease outcomes. A holistic understanding of the underlying mechanisms and non-genetic contributing factors in CF is central to development of new and targeted therapeutic strategies.",27919253,PMC5139081,10.1186/s12890-016-0339-5,,2016,"Bhagirath AY, Li Y, Somayajula D, Dadashi M, Badr S, Duan K.",Y,MED
Manipulating proteostasis to repair the F508del-CFTR defect in cystic fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal monogenic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that entails the (diagnostic) increase in sweat electrolyte concentrations, progressive lung disease with chronic inflammation and recurrent bacterial infections, pancreatic insufficiency, and male infertility. Therapies aimed at restoring the CFTR defect have emerged. Thus, a small molecule which facilitates chloride channel opening, the potentiator Ivacaftor, has been approved for the treatment of CF patients bearing a particular class of rare CFTR mutations. However, small molecules that directly target the most common misfolded CFTR mutant, F508del, and improve its intracellular trafficking in vitro, have been less effective than expected when tested in CF patients, even in combination with Ivacaftor. Thus, new strategies are required to circumvent the F508del-CFTR defect. Airway and intestinal epithelial cells from CF patients bearing the F508del-CFTR mutation exhibit an impressive derangement of cellular proteostasis, with oxidative stress, overactivation of the tissue transglutaminase (TG2), and disabled autophagy. Proteostasis regulators such as cysteamine can rescue and stabilize a functional F508del-CFTR protein through suppressing TG2 activation and restoring autophagy in vivo in F508del-CFTR homozygous mice, in vitro in CF patient-derived cell lines, ex vivo in freshly collected primary patient's nasal cells, as well as in a pilot clinical trial involving homozygous F508del-CFTR patients. Here, we discuss how the therapeutic normalization of defective proteostasis can be harnessed for the treatment of CF patients with the F508del-CFTR mutation.",26976279,PMC4791443,10.1186/s40348-016-0040-z,,2016,"Esposito S, Tosco A, Villella VR, Raia V, Kroemer G, Maiuri L.",Y,MED
Glucose >200 mg/dL during Continuous Glucose Monitoring Identifies Adult Patients at Risk for Development of Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes.,"*Rationale*. Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common comorbidity in patients with CF. In spite of increased screening, diagnosis, and treatment of CFRD, the mortality rate in patients with CFRD still far exceeds the mortality rate in those without CFRD. Guidelines suggest that screening for CFRD be performed annually using the 2-hour 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Adherence to recommended screening has been poor, with only approximately one-quarter of adults with CF undergoing OGTT in 2014. Use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for diagnosis may become an alternative. *Objectives*. Our objective was to determine whether abnormal CGM predicts subsequent development of CFRD, lung function, and body mass index (BMI) decline and increased rate of CF pulmonary exacerbations in adults with CF. *Methods*. In a prospective single center pilot trial from September 2009 to September 2010, 21 adult patients due for routine OGTT were recruited to complete simultaneous 3-day CGM and 2-hour 75 gram OGTT. Subsequently, clinical information was reviewed from 2008 to 2015. *Conclusions*. There was a moderate correlation between interpreted results of 2-hour OGTT and CGM (*p* = 0.03); CGM indicated a greater level of glucose impairment than OGTT. Glucose >200 mg/dL by CGM predicted development of CFRD (*p* = 0.0002).",27999822,PMC5143745,10.1155/2016/1527932,,2016,"Taylor-Cousar JL, Janssen JS, Wilson A, Clair CG, Pickard KM, Jones MC, Brayshaw SJ, Chacon CS, Barboa CM, Sontag MK, Accurso FJ, Nichols DP, Saavedra MT, Nick JA.",Y,MED
Identification of a novel functional miR-143-5p recognition element in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator 3'UTR.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs involved in regulation of gene expression. They bind in a sequence-specific manner to miRNA recognition elements (MREs) located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs and prevent mRNA translation. MiRNA expression is dysregulated in cystic fibrosis (CF), affecting several biological processes including ion conductance in the epithelial cells of the lung. We previously reported that miR-143 is up-regulated in CF bronchial brushings compared to non-CF. Here we identified two predicted binding sites for miR-143-5p (starting at residues 558 and 644) on the *CFTR* mRNA, and aimed to assess whether *CFTR* is a true molecular target of miR-143-5p. Expression of miR-143-5p was found to be up-regulated in a panel of CF vs non-CF cell lines (1.7-fold, P = 0.0165), and its levels were increased *in vitro* after 20 hours treatment with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from CF patients compared to vehicle-treated cells (3.3-fold, P = 0.0319). Luciferase assays were performed to elucidate direct miRNA::target interactions and showed that miR-143-5p significantly decreased the reporter activity when carrying the wild-type full length sequence of *CFTR* 3'UTR (minus 15%, P = 0.005). This repression was rescued by the disruption of the first, but not the second, predicted MRE, suggesting that the residue starting at 558 was the actual active binding site. In conclusion, we here showed that miR-143-5p modestly but significantly inhibits CFTR, improving the knowledge on functional MREs within the *CFTR* 3'UTR. This could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies where miRNA-mediated CFTR repression is blocked thereby possibly increasing the efficacy of the currently available CFTR modulators.",31435512,PMC6690249,10.3934/genet.2018.1.53,,2018,"De Santi C, Gadi S, Swiatecka-Urban A, Greene CM.",Y,MED

Proteostasis Regulators in Cystic Fibrosis: Current Development and Future Perspectives.,"In cystic fibrosis (CF), the deletion of phenylalanine 508 (F508del) in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) leads to misfolding and premature degradation of the mutant protein. These defects can be targeted with pharmacological agents named potentiators and correctors. During the past years, several efforts have been devoted to develop and approve new effective molecules. However, their clinical use remains limited, as they fail to fully restore F508del-CFTR biological function. Indeed, the search for CFTR correctors with different and additive mechanisms has recently increased. Among them, drugs that modulate the CFTR proteostasis environment are particularly attractive to enhance therapy effectiveness further. This Perspective focuses on reviewing the recent progress in discovering CFTR proteostasis regulators, mainly describing the design, chemical structure, and structure-activity relationships. The opportunities, challenges, and future directions in this emerging and promising field of research are discussed, as well.",35377645,PMC9014417,10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c01897,,2022,"Brusa I, Sondo E, Falchi F, Pedemonte N, Roberti M, Cavalli A.",Y,MED
Prognostication and Risk Factors for Cystic Fibrosis via Automated Machine Learning.,"Accurate prediction of survival for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is instrumental in establishing the optimal timing for referring patients with terminal respiratory failure for lung transplantation (LT). Current practice considers referring patients for LT evaluation once the forced expiratory volume (FEV1) drops below 30% of its predicted nominal value. While FEV1 is indeed a strong predictor of CF-related mortality, we hypothesized that the survival behavior of CF patients exhibits a lot more heterogeneity. To this end, we developed an algorithmic framework, which we call AutoPrognosis, that leverages the power of machine learning to automate the process of constructing clinical prognostic models, and used it to build a prognostic model for CF using data from a contemporary cohort that involved 99% of the CF population in the UK. AutoPrognosis uses Bayesian optimization techniques to automate the process of configuring ensembles of machine learning pipelines, which involve imputation, feature processing, classification and calibration algorithms. Because it is automated, it can be used by clinical researchers to build prognostic models without the need for in-depth knowledge of machine learning. Our experiments revealed that the accuracy of the model learned by AutoPrognosis is superior to that of existing guidelines and other competing models.",30050169,PMC6062529,10.1038/s41598-018-29523-2,,2018,"Alaa AM, van der Schaar M.",Y,MED
Structure-guided combination therapy to potently improve the function of mutant CFTRs.,"Available corrector drugs are unable to effectively rescue the folding defects of CFTR-ΔF508 (or CFTR-F508del﻿), the most common disease-causing mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, a plasma membrane (PM) anion channel, and thus to substantially ameliorate clinical phenotypes of cystic fibrosis (CF). To overcome the corrector efficacy ceiling, here we show that compounds targeting distinct structural defects of CFTR can synergistically rescue mutant expression and function at the PM. High-throughput cell-based screens and mechanistic analysis identified three small-molecule series that target defects at nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1), NBD2 and their membrane-spanning domain (MSD) interfaces. Although individually these compounds marginally improve ΔF508-CFTR folding efficiency, function and stability, their combinations lead to ~50-100% of wild-type-level correction in immortalized and primary human airway epithelia and in mouse nasal epithelia. Likewise, corrector combinations were effective against rare missense mutations in various CFTR domains, probably acting via structural allostery, suggesting a mechanistic framework for their broad application.",30297908,PMC6301090,10.1038/s41591-018-0200-x,,2018,"Veit G, Xu H, Dreano E, Avramescu RG, Bagdany M, Beitel LK, Roldan A, Hancock MA, Lay C, Li W, Morin K, Gao S, Mak PA, Ainscow E, Orth AP, McNamara P, Edelman A, Frenkiel S, Matouk E, Sermet-Gaudelus I, Barnes WG, Lukacs GL.",Y,MED
Human Growth and Growth Hormone: From Antiquity to the Recominant Age to the Future.,"Since antiquity Man has been fascinated by the variations in human (and animal) growth. Stories and art abound about giants and little people. Modern genetics have solved some of etiologies at both extremes of growth. Serious study began with the pathophysiology of acromegaly followed by early attempts at treatment culminating in modern endoscopic surgery and multiple pharmacologic agents. Virtually at the same time experiments with the removal of the pituitary from laboratory animals noted the slowing or stopping of linear growth and then over a few decades the extraction and purification of a protein within the anterior pituitary that restored, partially or in full, the animal's growth. Human growth hormone was purified decades after those from large animals and it was noted that it was species specific, that is, only primate growth hormone was metabolically active in primates. That was quite unlike the beef and pork insulins which revolutionized the care of children with diabetes mellitus. A number of studies included mild enzymatic digestion of beef growth hormone to determine if those ""cores"" had biologic activity in primates and man. Tantalizing data showed minimal but variable metabolic efficacy leading to the ""active core"" hypothesis, for these smaller peptides would be amenable to peptide synthesis in the time before recombinant DNA. Recombinant DNA changed the landscape remarkably promising nearly unlimited quantities of metabolically active hormone. Eight indications for therapeutic use have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and a large number of clinical trials have been undertaken in multiple other conditions for which short stature in childhood is a sign. The future predicts other clinical indications for growth hormone therapy (and perhaps other components of the GH?IGF-1 axis), longer-acting analogues and perhaps a more physiologic method of administration as virtually all methods at present are far from physiologic.",34290673,PMC8287422,10.3389/fendo.2021.709936,,2021,"Graber E, Reiter EO, Rogol AD.",Y,MED
Orkambi® and amplifier co-therapy improves function from a rare *CFTR* mutation in gene-edited cells and patient tissue.,"The combination therapy of lumacaftor and ivacaftor (Orkambi®) is approved for patients bearing the major cystic fibrosis (CF) mutation: *ΔF508* It has been predicted that Orkambi® could treat patients with rarer mutations of similar ""theratype""; however, a standardized approach confirming efficacy in these cohorts has not been reported. Here, we demonstrate that patients bearing the rare mutation: c.3700 A>G, causing protein misprocessing and altered channel function-similar to ΔF508-CFTR, are unlikely to yield a robust Orkambi® response. While *in silico* and biochemical studies confirmed that this mutation could be corrected and potentiated by lumacaftor and ivacaftor, respectively, this combination led to a minor *in vitro* response in patient-derived tissue. A CRISPR/Cas9-edited bronchial epithelial cell line bearing this mutation enabled studies showing that an ""amplifier"" compound, effective in increasing the levels of immature CFTR protein, augmented the Orkambi® response. Importantly, this ""amplifier"" effect was recapitulated in patient-derived nasal cultures-providing the first evidence for its efficacy in augmenting Orkambi® in tissues harboring a rare CF-causing mutation. We propose that this multi-disciplinary approach, including creation of CRISPR/Cas9-edited cells to profile modulators together with validation using primary tissue, will facilitate therapy development for patients with rare CF mutations.",28667089,PMC5582412,10.15252/emmm.201607137,,2017,"Molinski SV, Ahmadi S, Ip W, Ouyang H, Villella A, Miller JP, Lee PS, Kulleperuma K, Du K, Di Paola M, Eckford PD, Laselva O, Huan LJ, Wellhauser L, Li E, Ray PN, Pomès R, Moraes TJ, Gonska T, Ratjen F, Bear CE.",Y,MED
Delivering on the promise of gene editing for cystic fibrosis.,"In this review, we describe a path for translation of gene editing into therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF). Cystic fibrosis results from mutations in the CFTR gene, with one allele predominant in patient populations. This simple, genetic etiology makes gene editing appealing for treatment of this disease. There already have been success in applying this approach to cystic fibrosis in cell and animal models, although these advances have been modest in comparison to advances for other disease. Less than six years after its first demonstration in animals, CRISPR/Cas gene editing is in early clinical trials for several disorders. Most clinical trials, thus far, attempt to edit genes in cells of the blood lineages. The advantage of the blood is that the stem cells are known, can be isolated, edited, selected, expanded, and returned to the body. The likely next trials will be in the liver, which is accessible to many delivery methods. For cystic fibrosis, the biggest hurdle is to deliver editors to other, less accessible organs. We outline a path by which delivery can be improved. The translation of new therapies doesn't occur in isolation, and the development of gene editors is occurring as advances in gene therapy and small molecule therapeutics are being made. The advances made in gene therapy may help develop delivery vehicles for gene editing, although major improvements are needed. Conversely, the approval of effective small molecule therapies for many patients with cystic fibrosis will raise the bar for translation of gene editing.",31193992,PMC6545485,10.1016/j.gendis.2018.11.005,,2019,"Hodges CA, Conlon RA.",Y,MED
Outcome evaluation of a pharmacy-based therapy management program for patients with cystic fibrosis.,"Objective: To compare medication adherence, pulmonary exacerbations, healthcare utilization, and costs for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who utilized a pharmacy-based therapy management program to a matched control group. We hypothesized that patient management services would be associated with better medication adherence, and thus require fewer visits to the emergency room or hospitalizations.Methods: This retrospective, observational cohort study used claims data from the MORE2 claims Registry®. The sample consisted of CF patients, aged 6+, who had ≥1 pharmacy claim for inhaled tobramycin, inhaled aztreonam, ivacaftor, or dornase alfa from 6/2/2014-5/31/2015. Adherence was measured as proportion of days covered (PDC). Propensity score matching and multivariable regression techniques were used to compare outcomes in program participants to matched controls.Results: Of the 236 intervention and 724 control patients meeting selection criteria, 202 were propensity-matched from each cohort. Relative to the control cohort, program patients had 23% higher mean PDC for tobramycin (IRR = 1.23, P = 0.01) and were twice as likely to be adherent to tobramycin (PDC ≥ 80%) than matched controls (OR = 2.14, P = 0.04). Program patients had fewer ER visits (IRR = 0.52, P < 0.01) and slightly lower ER costs (IRR = 0.66, P = 0.06) than the control patients.Conclusion: A pharmacy-based therapy management program for CF patients was associated with higher adherence to inhaled tobramycin and lower ER rates.

Relation of Ultrasound Findings and Abdominal Symptoms obtained with the CFAbd-Score in Cystic Fibrosis Patients.,"Abdominal symptoms are a hallmark of Cystic fibrosis (CF). Yet, their association with morphological abnormalities of different abdominal organs is still poorly understood. Aim was therefore to relate these symptoms, assessed with a questionnaire, to findings in abdominal ultrasound (US). In 114 CF patients of all ages, findings in US considering seventeen specific parameters were related to abdominal symptoms compiled with our novel CF-specific 26-modal symptom score (CFAbd-Score). US abnormalities were detected in 95% of the patients. Most frequent findings were pancreatic lipomatosis (88%), liver steatosis (37%), hepatomegaly (31%), and thickened bowel walls (23%). Highest burden of GI-symptoms was clearly associated with pancreatic lipomatosis (p = 0.036). In detail, patients revealing this pathology reported higher rates of abdominal pain (p = 0.018), flatulence (p = 0.006), heartburn (p = 0.04), and reflux of stomach content (p = 0.006). Patients with pancreatic sufficiency had less US-findings (p = 0.033), which in turn was associated with lower rates of abdominal symptoms. The majority of them were carriers of class IV-VI or G551D mutations. Our approach gives new insights regarding the underestimated multi-organ abdominal involvement in CF. The new score can be of high interest e.g. as a complementary tool to assess the gastrointestinal effects of promising novel CF therapeutics.",29234058,PMC5727223,10.1038/s41598-017-17302-4,,2017,"Tabori H, Jaudszus A, Arnold C, Mentzel HJ, Lorenz M, Michl RK, Lehmann T, Renz DM, Mainz JG.",Y,MED
TMEM16A in Cystic Fibrosis: Activating or Inhibiting?,"The inflammatory airway disease cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by airway obstruction due to mucus hypersecretion, airway plugging, and bronchoconstriction. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel is dysfunctional in CF, leading to defects in epithelial transport. Although CF pathogenesis is still disputed, activation of alternative Cl- channels is assumed to improve lung function in CF. Two suitable non-CFTR Cl- channels are present in the airway epithelium, the Ca2+ activated channel TMEM16A and SLC26A9. Activation of these channels is thought to be feasible to improve hydration of the airway mucus and to increase mucociliary clearance. Interestingly, both channels are upregulated during inflammatory lung disease. They are assumed to support fluid secretion, necessary to hydrate excess mucus and to maintain mucus clearance. During inflammation, however, TMEM16A is upregulated particularly in mucus producing cells, with only little expression in ciliated cells. Recently it was shown that knockout of TMEM16A in ciliated cells strongly compromises Cl- conductance and attenuated mucus secretion, but does not lead to a CF-like lung disease and airway plugging. Along this line, activation of TMEM16A by denufosol, a stable purinergic ligand, failed to demonstrate any benefit to CF patients in earlier studies. It rather induced adverse effects such as cough. A number of studies suggest that TMEM16A is essential for mucus secretion and possibly also for mucus production. Evidence is now provided for a crucial role of TMEM16A in fusion of mucus-filled granules with the apical plasma membrane and cellular exocytosis. This is probably due to local Ca2+ signals facilitated by TMEM16A. Taken together, TMEM16A supports fluid secretion by ciliated airway epithelial cells, but also maintains excessive mucus secretion during inflammatory airway disease. Because TMEM16A also supports airway smooth muscle contraction, inhibition rather than activation of TMEM16A might be the appropriate treatment for CF lung disease, asthma and COPD. As a number of FDA-approved and well-tolerated drugs have been shown to inhibit TMEM16A, evaluation in clinical trials appears timely.",30761000,PMC6362895,10.3389/fphar.2019.00003,,2019,"Kunzelmann K, Ousingsawat J, Cabrita I, Doušová T, Bähr A, Janda M, Schreiber R, Benedetto R.",Y,MED
Emerging Therapeutic Approaches for Cystic Fibrosis.

Other therapies that are in preclinical development are not mutation specific and include gene therapy to edit the genome and stem cell therapy to repair the airway tissue. These strategies that are directed at the basic CF defects are now revolutionizing the treatment for patients and should positively impact their survival rates.",30873022,PMC6400831,10.3389/fphar.2019.00121,,2019,"Pranke I, Golec A, Hinzpeter A, Edelman A, Sermet-Gaudelus I.",Y,MED
Phenotypic profiling of CFTR modulators in patient-derived respiratory epithelia.,"Pulmonary disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis, a disease caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. Heterogeneity in CFTR genotype-phenotype relationships in affected individuals plus the escalation of drug discovery targeting specific mutations highlights the need to develop robust in vitro platforms with which to stratify therapeutic options using relevant tissue. Toward this goal, we adapted a fluorescence plate reader assay of apical CFTR-mediated chloride conductance to enable profiling of a panel of modulators on primary nasal epithelial cultures derived from patients bearing different CFTR mutations. This platform faithfully recapitulated patient-specific responses previously observed in the ""gold-standard"" but relatively low-throughput Ussing chamber. Moreover, using this approach, we identified a novel strategy with which to augment the response to an approved drug in specific patients. In proof of concept studies, we also validated the use of this platform in measuring drug responses in lung cultures differentiated from cystic fibrosis iPS cells.

The most common mutation F508del inhibits folding and processing of CFTR protein. FDA-approved correctors rescue the biosynthetic processing of F508del-CFTR protein, while potentiators improve the rescued CFTR channel function. Transforming growth factor (TGF-β1), overexpressed in many CF patients, blocks corrector/potentiator rescue by inhibiting CFTR mRNA in vitro. Increased TGF-β1 signaling and acquired CFTR dysfunction are present in other lung diseases. To study the mechanism of TGF-β1 repression of CFTR, we used molecular, biochemical, and functional approaches in primary human bronchial epithelial cells from over 50 donors. TGF-β1 destabilized CFTR mRNA in cells from lungs with chronic disease, including CF, and impaired F508del-CFTR rescue by new-generation correctors. TGF-β1 increased the active pool of selected micro(mi)RNAs validated as CFTR inhibitors, recruiting them to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Expression of F508del-CFTR globally modulated TGF-β1-induced changes in the miRNA landscape, creating a permissive environment required for degradation of F508del-CFTR mRNA. In conclusion, TGF-β1 may impede the full benefit of corrector/potentiator therapy in CF patients. Studying miRNA recruitment to RISC under disease-specific conditions may help to better characterize the miRNAs utilized by TGF-β1 to destabilize CFTR mRNA.",31590401,PMC6801718,10.3390/ijms20194933,,2019,"Mitash N, Mu F, Donovan JE, Myerburg MM, Ranganathan S, Greene CM, Swiatecka-Urban A.",Y,MED
Gene Therapy in Rare Respiratory Diseases: What Have We Learned So Far?,"Gene therapy is an alternative therapy in many respiratory diseases with genetic origin and currently without curative treatment. After five decades of progress, many different vectors and gene editing tools for genetic engineering are now available. However, we are still a long way from achieving a safe and efficient approach to gene therapy application in clinical practice. Here, we review three of the most common rare respiratory conditions-cystic fibrosis (CF), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)-alongside attempts to develop genetic treatment for these diseases. Since the 1990s, gene augmentation therapy has been applied in multiple clinical trials targeting CF and AATD, especially using adeno-associated viral vectors, resulting in a good safety profile but with low efficacy in protein expression. Other strategies, such as non-viral vectors and more recently gene editing tools, have also been used to address these diseases in pre-clinical studies. The first gene therapy approach in PCD was in 2009 when a lentiviral transduction was performed to restore gene expression in vitro; since then, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) technology has also been applied in primary cell culture. Gene therapy is an encouraging alternative treatment for these respiratory diseases; however, more research is needed to ensure treatment safety and efficacy.",32784514,PMC7463867,10.3390/jcm9082577,,2020,"Bañuls L, Pellicer D, Castillo S, Navarro-García MM, Magallón M, González C, Dasí F.",Y,MED
Conversion of human and mouse fibroblasts into lung-like epithelial cells.,"Cell lineage conversion of fibroblasts to specialized cell types through transdifferentiation may provide a fast and alternative cell source for regenerative medicine. Here we show that transient transduction of fibroblasts with the four reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) in addition to the early lung transcription factor Nkx2-1 (also known as Ttf1), followed by directed differentiation of the cells, can convert mouse embryonic and human adult dermal fibroblasts into induced lung-like epithelial cells (iLEC). These iLEC differentiate into multiple lung cell types in air liquid interface cultures, repopulate decellularized rat lung scaffolds, and form lung epithelia composed of Ciliated, Goblet, Basal, and Club cells after transplantation into immune-compromised mice. As proof-of-concept, differentiated human iLEC harboring the Cystic Fibrosis mutation dF508 demonstrated pharmacological rescue of CFTR function using the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. Overall, this is a promising alternative approach for generation of patient-specific lung-like progenitors to study lung function, disease and future regeneration strategies.",31227724,PMC6588580,10.1038/s41598-019-45195-y,,2019,"Wong AP, Shojaie S, Liang Q, Xia S, Di Paola M, Ahmadi S, Bilodeau C, Garner J, Post M, Duchesneau P, Waddell TK, Bear CE, Nagy A, Rossant J.",Y,MED
Gene Therapy for Cystic Fibrosis Lung Disease: Overcoming the Barriers to Translation to the Clinic.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive, chronic and debilitating genetic disease caused by mutations in the CF Transmembrane-Conductance Regulator (*CFTR*) gene. Unrelenting airway disease begins in infancy and produces a steady deterioration in quality of life, ultimately leading to premature death. While life expectancy has improved, current treatments for CF are neither preventive nor curative. Since the discovery of *CFTR* the vision of correcting the underlying genetic defect - not just treating the symptoms - has been developed to where it is poised to become a transformative technology. Addition of a properly functioning *CFTR* gene into defective airway cells is the only biologically rational way to prevent or treat CF airway disease for *all CFTR* mutation classes. While new gene editing approaches hold exciting promise, airway gene-addition therapy remains the most encouraging therapeutic approach for CF. However, early work has not yet progressed to large-scale clinical trials. For clinical trials to begin in earnest the field must demonstrate that gene therapies are safe in CF lungs; can provide clear health benefits and alter the course of lung disease; can be repeatedly dosed to boost effect; and can be scaled effectively from small animal models into human-sized lungs. Demonstrating the durability of these effects demands relevant CF animal models and accurate and reliable techniques to measure benefit. In this review, illustrated with data from our own studies, we outline recent technological developments and discuss these key questions that we believe must be answered to progress CF airway gene-addition therapies to clinical trials.",30538635,PMC6277470,10.3389/fphar.2018.01381,,2018,"Donnelley M, Parsons DW.",Y,MED
The potential of antisense oligonucleotide therapies for inherited childhood lung diseases.,"Antisense oligonucleotides are an emerging therapeutic option to treat diseases with known genetic origin. In the age of personalised medicines, antisense oligonucleotides can sometimes be designed to target and bypass or overcome a patient's genetic mutation, in particular those lesions that compromise normal pre-mRNA processing. Antisense oligonucleotides can alter gene expression through a variety of mechanisms as determined by the chemistry and antisense oligomer design. Through targeting the pre-mRNA, antisense oligonucleotides can alter splicing and induce a specific spliceoform or disrupt the reading frame, target an RNA transcript for degradation through RNaseH activation, block ribosome initiation of protein translation or disrupt miRNA function. The recent accelerated approval of eteplirsen (renamed Exondys 51™) by the Food and Drug Administration, for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and nusinersen, for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy, herald a new and exciting era in splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide applications to treat inherited diseases. This review considers the potential of antisense oligonucleotides to treat inherited lung diseases of childhood with a focus on cystic fibrosis and disorders of surfactant protein metabolism.",29411170,PMC5801198,10.1186/s40348-018-0081-6,,2018,"Martinovich KM, Shaw NC, Kicic A, Schultz A, Fletcher S, Wilton SD, Stick SM.",Y,MED
Cigarette Smoke-Induced Acquired Dysfunction of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator in the Pathogenesis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. Cigarette smoke and oxidative stress are main etiological risks in COPD. Interestingly, recent studies suggest a considerable overlap between chronic bronchitis (CB) phenotypic COPD and cystic fibrosis (CF), a common fatal hereditary lung disease caused by genetic mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Phenotypically, CF and COPD are associated with an impaired mucociliary clearance and mucus hypersecretion, although they are two distinct entities of unrelated origin. Mechanistically, the cigarette smoke-increased oxidative stress-induced CFTR dysfunction is implicated in COPD. This underscores CFTR in understanding and improving therapies for COPD by altering CFTR function with antioxidant agents and CFTR modulators as a great promising strategy for COPD treatments. Indeed, treatments that restore CFTR function, including mucolytic therapy, antioxidant ROS scavenger, CFTR stimulator (roflumilast), and CFTR potentiator (ivacaftor), have been tested in COPD. This review article is aimed at summarizing the molecular, cellular, and clinical evidence of oxidative stress, particularly the cigarette smoke-increased oxidative stress-impaired CFTR function, as well as signaling pathways of CFTR involved in the pathogenesis of COPD, with a highlight on the therapeutic potential of targeting CFTR for COPD treatment.",29849907,PMC5937428,10.1155/2018/6567578,,2018,"Shi J, Li H, Yuan C, Luo M, Wei J, Liu X.",Y,MED

Thymosin α1 represents a potential potent single-molecule-based therapy for cystic fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that compromise its chloride channel activity. The most common mutation, p.Phe508del, results in the production of a misfolded CFTR protein, which has residual channel activity but is prematurely degraded. Because of the inherent complexity of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in CF, which include impaired chloride permeability and persistent lung inflammation, a multidrug approach is required for efficacious CF therapy. To date, no individual drug with pleiotropic beneficial effects is available for CF. Here we report on the ability of thymosin alpha 1 (Tα1)-a naturally occurring polypeptide with an excellent safety profile in the clinic when used as an adjuvant or an immunotherapeutic agent-to rectify the multiple tissue defects in mice with CF as well as in cells from subjects with the p.Phe508del mutation. Tα1 displayed two combined properties that favorably opposed CF symptomatology: it reduced inflammation and increased CFTR maturation, stability and activity. By virtue of this two-pronged action, Tα1 has strong potential to be an efficacious single-molecule-based therapeutic agent for CF.",28394330,PMC5420451,10.1038/nm.4305,,2017,"Romani L, Oikonomou V, Moretti S, Iannitti RG, D'Adamo MC, Villella VR, Pariano M, Sforna L, Borghi M, Bellet MM, Fallarino F, Pallotta MT, Servillo G, Ferrari E, Puccetti P, Kroemer G, Pessia M, Maiuri L, Goldstein AL, Garaci E.",Y,MED
Effective silencing of ENaC by siRNA delivered with epithelial-targeted nanocomplexes in human cystic fibrosis cells and in mouse lung.,"Introduction: Loss of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in cystic fibrosis (CF) leads to hyperabsorption of sodium and fluid from the airway due to upregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Thickened mucus and depleted airway surface liquid (ASL) then lead to impaired mucociliary clearance. ENaC regulation is thus a promising target for CF therapy. Our aim was to develop siRNA nanocomplexes that mediate effective silencing of airway epithelial ENaC in vitro and in vivo with functional correction of epithelial ion and fluid transport.Methods: We investigated translocation of nanocomplexes through mucus and their transfection efficiency in primary CF epithelial cells grown at air-liquid interface (ALI).Short interfering RNA (SiRNA)-mediated silencing was examined by quantitative RT-PCR and western analysis of ENaC. Transepithelial potential (Vt), short circuit current (Isc), ASL depth and ciliary beat frequency (CBF) were measured for functional analysis. Inflammation was analysed by histological analysis of normal mouse lung tissue sections.Results: Nanocomplexes translocated more rapidly than siRNA alone through mucus. Transfections of primary CF epithelial cells with nanocomplexes targeting αENaC siRNA, reduced αENaC and βENaC mRNA by 30%. Transfections reduced Vt, the amiloride-sensitive Isc and mucus protein concentration while increasing ASL depth and CBF to normal levels. A single dose of siRNA in mouse lung silenced ENaC by approximately 30%, which persisted for at least 7 days. Three doses of siRNA increased silencing to approximately 50%.Conclusion: Nanoparticle-mediated delivery of ENaCsiRNA to ALI cultures corrected aspects of the mucociliary defect in human CF cells and offers effective delivery and silencing in vivo.",29748250,PMC6109249,10.1136/thoraxjnl-2017-210670,,2018,"Tagalakis AD, Munye MM, Ivanova R, Chen H, Smith CM, Aldossary AM, Rosa LZ, Moulding D, Barnes JL, Kafetzis KN, Jones SA, Baines DL, Moss GWJ, O'Callaghan C, McAnulty RJ, Hart SL.",Y,MED
Identification and Characterization of Novel CFTR Potentiators.,"There is still a high unmet need for the treatment of most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The identification and development of new Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) modulators is necessary to achieve higher clinical benefit in patients. In this report we describe the characterization of novel potentiators. From a small screening campaign on F508del CFTR, hits were developed leading to the identification of pre-clinical candidates GLPG1837 and GLPG2451, each derived from a distinct chemical series. Both drug candidates enhance WT CFTR activity as well as low temperature or corrector rescued F508del CFTR, and are able to improve channel activity on a series of Class III, IV CFTR mutants. The observed activities in YFP halide assays translated well to primary cells derived from CF lungs when measured using Trans-epithelial clamp circuit (TECC). Both potentiators improve F508del CFTR channel opening in a similar manner, increasing the open time and reducing the closed time of the channel. When evaluating the potentiators in a chronic setting on corrected F508del CFTR, no reduction of channel activity in presence of potentiator was observed. The current work identifies and characterizes novel CFTR potentiators GLPG1837 and GLPG2451, which may offer new therapeutic options for CF patients.",30416447,PMC6212544,10.3389/fphar.2018.01221,,2018,"Gees M, Musch S, Van der Plas S, Wesse AS, Vandevelde A, Verdonck K, Mammoliti O, Hwang TC, Sonck K, Stouten P, Swensen AM, Jans M, Van der Schueren J, Nelles L, Andrews M, Conrath K.",Y,MED
"Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) in Human Lung Microvascular Endothelial Cells Controls Oxidative Stress, Reactive Oxygen-Mediated Cell Signaling and Inflammatory Responses.","Background: Perturbation of endothelial function in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been reported, which may be associated with endothelial cell expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Previous reports indicate that CFTR activity upregulates endothelial barrier function, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and NO release, while limiting interleukin-8 (IL-8) release, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in cell culture. In view of reported microvascular dysfunction in people with CF we investigated the role of CFTR expression and activity in the regulation of oxidative stress, cell signaling and inflammation in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) in cell culture.Methods: HLMVECs were cultured in the absence and presence of the CFTR inhibitor GlyH-101 and CFTR siRNA. CFTR expression was analyzed using qRT-PCR, immunocytochemistry (IHC) and western blot, and function by membrane potential assay. IL-8 expression was analyzed using qRT-PCR and ELISA. Nrf2 expression, and NF-κB and AP-1 activation were determined using IHC and western blot. The role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in CFTR signaling was investigated using the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478. Oxidative stress was measured as intracellular ROS and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration. VEGF and SOD-2 were measured in culture supernatants by ELISA.Results: HLMVECs express low levels of CFTR that increase following inhibition of CFTR activity. Inhibition of CFTR, significantly increased intracellular ROS and H2O2 levels over 30 min and significantly decreased Nrf2 expression by 70% while increasing SOD-2 expression over 24 h. CFTR siRNA significantly increased constitutive expression of IL-8 by HLMVECs. CFTR inhibition activated the AP-1 pathway and increased IL-8 expression, without effect on NF-κB activity. Conversely, TNF-α activated the NF-κB pathway and increased IL-8 expression. The effects of TNF-α and GlyH-101 on IL-8 expression were additive and inhibited by AG1478. Inhibition of both CFTR and EGFR in HLMVECs significantly increased VEGF expression. The antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine significantly reduced ROS production and the increase in IL-8 and VEGF expression following CFTR inhibition.Conclusion: Functional endothelial CFTR limits oxidative stress and contributes to the normal anti-inflammatory state of HLMVECs. Therapeutic strategies to restore endothelial CFTR function in CF are warranted.",32848840,PMC7403513,10.3389/fphys.2020.00879,,2020,"Khalaf M, Scott-Ward T, Causer A, Saynor Z, Shepherd A, Górecki D, Lewis A, Laight D, Shute J.",Y,MED
Nutritional immunity: the impact of metals on lung immune cells and the airway microbiome during chronic respiratory disease.,"Nutritional immunity is the sequestration of bioavailable trace metals such as iron, zinc and copper by the host to limit pathogenicity by invading microorganisms. As one of the most conserved activities of the innate immune system, limiting the availability of free trace metals by cells of the immune system serves not only to conceal these vital nutrients from invading bacteria but also operates to tightly regulate host immune cell responses and function. In the setting of chronic lung disease, the regulation of trace metals by the host is often disrupted, leading to the altered availability of these nutrients to commensal and invading opportunistic pathogenic microbes. Similarly, alterations in the uptake, secretion, turnover and redox activity of these vitally important metals has significant repercussions for immune cell function including the response to and resolution of infection. This review will discuss the intricate role of nutritional immunity in host immune cells of the lung and how changes in this fundamental process as a result of chronic lung disease may alter the airway microbiome, disease progression and the response to infection.",33926483,PMC8082489,10.1186/s12931-021-01722-y,,2021,"Healy C, Munoz-Wolf N, Strydom J, Faherty L, Williams NC, Kenny S, Donnelly SC, Cloonan SM.",Y,MED
Review: immunosuppression for the lung transplant patient.,"Lung transplantation (LTx) has evolved significantly since its inception and the improvement in LTx outcomes over the last three decades has predominantly been driven by advances in immunosuppression management. Despite the lack of new classes of immunosuppression medications, immunosuppressive strategies have evolved significantly from a universal method to a more targeted approach, reflecting a greater understanding of the need for individualized therapy and careful consideration of all factors that are influenced by immunosuppression choice. This has become increasingly important as the demographics of lung transplant recipients have changed over time, with older and more medically complex candidates being accepted and undergoing LTx. Furthermore, improved survival post lung transplant has translated into more immunosuppression related comorbidities long-term, predominantly chronic kidney disease (CKD) and malignancy, which has required further nuanced management approaches. This review provides an update on current traditional lung transplant immunosuppression strategies, with modifications based on pre-existing recipient factors and comorbidities, peri-operative challenges and long term complications, balanced against the perpetual challenge of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). As we continue to explore and understand the complexity of LTx immunology and the interplay of different factors, immunosuppression strategies will require ongoing critical evaluation and personalization in order to continue to improve lung transplant outcomes.",34992841,PMC8662512,10.21037/jtd-2021-11,,2021,"Kotecha S, Ivulich S, Snell G.",Y,MED
A computational essential dynamics approach to investigate structural influences of ligand binding on Papain like protease from SARS-CoV-2.,"Papain like protease (PLpro) is a cysteine protease from the coronaviridae family of viruses. Coronaviruses possess a positive sense, single-strand RNA, leading to the translation of two viral polypeptides containing viral structural, non-structural and accessory proteins. PLpro is responsible for the cleavage of nsp1-3 from the viral polypeptide. PLpro also possesses deubiquitinating and deISGlyating activity, which sequesters the virus from the host's immune system. This indispensable attribute of PLpro makes it a protein of interest as a drug target. The present study aims to analyze the structural influences of ligand binding on PLpro. First, PLpro was screened against the ZINC-in-trials library, from which four lead compounds were identified based on estimated binding affinity and interaction patterns. Next, based on molecular docking results, ZINC000000596945, ZINC000064033452 and VIR251 (control molecule) were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation. The study evaluated global and essential dynamics analyses utilising principal component analyses, dynamic cross-correlation matrix, free energy landscape and time-dependant essential dynamics to predict the structural changes observed in PLpro upon ligand binding in a simulated environment. The MM/PBSA-based binding free energy calculations of the two selected molecules, ZINC000000596945 (-41.23 ± 3.70 kcal/mol) and ZINC000064033452 (-25.10 ± 2.65 kcal/mol), displayed significant values which delineate them as potential inhibitors of PLpro from SARS-CoV-2.",35835027,PMC9238113,10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2022.107721,,2022,"Singh E, Jha RK, Khan RJ, Kumar A, Jain M, Muthukumaran J, Singh AK.",Y,MED
Update on key emerging challenges in cystic fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease causing severe chronic sinopulmonary disease and loss of pancreatic exocrine function, which affects approximately 70,000 individuals worldwide. New therapeutic developments over the last few decades have resulted in a significant increase in survival, with the median predicted survival now reaching the late thirties and more and more CF patients living well into adulthood. However, with this advent of new therapies and the associated increase in survival, new challenges in CF care have also emerged. Two of these challenges, i.e. chronic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus lung infection and patient adherence to very complicated and time-consuming therapeutic regimens, are reviewed in detail here. In addition, the ultimate challenge of treating the underlying cause of CF by correcting the dysfunction of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channel is reviewed, as agents to correct channel function will likely significantly alter CF clinical outcomes and treatment approaches in the next decade.",24434297,PMC5586905,10.1159/000357646,,2014,"Jennings MT, Riekert KA, Boyle MP.",Y,MED
Cysteamine re-establishes the clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by macrophages bearing the cystic fibrosis-relevant F508del-CFTR mutation.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common lethal monogenic disease in Caucasians, is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections and colonization, mainly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, resulting in unresolved airway inflammation. CF is caused by mutations in the gene coding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which functions as a chloride channel in epithelial cells, macrophages, and other cell types. Impaired bacterial handling by macrophages is a feature of CF airways, although it is still debated how defective CFTR impairs bacterial killing. Recent evidence indicates that a defective autophagy in CF macrophages leads to alterations of bacterial clearance upon infection. Here we use bone marrow-derived macrophages from transgenic mice to provide the genetic proof that defective CFTR compromises both uptake and clearance of internalized Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We demonstrate that the proteostasis regulator cysteamine, which rescues the function of the most common F508del-CFTR mutant and hence reduces lung inflammation in CF patients, can also repair the defects of CF macrophages, thus restoring both bacterial internalization and clearance through a process that involves upregulation of the pro-autophagic protein Beclin 1 and re-establishment of the autophagic pathway. Altogether these results indicate that cysteamine restores the function of several distinct cell types, including that of macrophages, which might contribute to its beneficial effects on CF.",28079883,PMC5386380,10.1038/cddis.2016.476,,2017,"Ferrari E, Monzani R, Villella VR, Esposito S, Saluzzo F, Rossin F, D'Eletto M, Tosco A, De Gregorio F, Izzo V, Maiuri MC, Kroemer G, Raia V, Maiuri L.",Y,MED
Peripheral Protein Quality Control as a Novel Drug Target for CFTR Stabilizer.,"Conformationally defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) including rescued ΔF508-CFTR is rapidly eliminated from the plasma membrane (PM) even in the presence of a CFTR corrector and potentiator, limiting the therapeutic effort of the combination therapy. CFTR elimination from the PM is determined by the conformation-dependent ubiquitination as a part of the peripheral quality control (PQC) mechanism. Recently, the molecular machineries responsible for the CFTR PQC mechanism which includes molecular chaperones and ubiquitination enzymes have been revealed. This review summarizes the molecular mechanism of the CFTR PQC and discusses the possibility that the peripheral ubiquitination mechanism becomes a novel drug target to develop the CFTR stabilizer as a novel class of CFTR modulator.",30319426,PMC6170605,10.3389/fphar.2018.01100,,2018,"Fukuda R, Okiyoneda T.",Y,MED
The TAK1→IKKβ→TPL2→MKK1/MKK2 Signaling Cascade Regulates IL-33 Expression in Cystic Fibrosis Airway Epithelial Cells Following Infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,"In cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic respiratory infections result in an exaggerated and uncontrolled inflammatory response that ultimately lead to a decrease in pulmonary function. We have previously described the presence of the alarmin IL-33 in lung explants from CF patients. The signals regulating IL-33 expression in the airway epithelium following a gram-negative bacterial infection are currently unknown. Our objective was to characterize the pathways in CF airway epithelial cells (AECs) leading to an increase in IL-33 expression. We found that, in CF AECs expressing a deletion of a phenylalanine at position 508 of the gene coding for Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTRdelF508), exposure to live Pseudomonas aeruginosa upregulates IL-33 via the TLR2 and TLR5 signaling pathways. This up-regulation can be partially or fully reverted by pre-incubating CFTRdelF508 AECs with a CFTR corrector (VX-809) and/or a CFTR potentiator (VX-770). Similarly, incubation with the CFTR corrector and/or the CFTR potentiator also decreased IL-8 expression in response to infection. Moreover, using different protein kinase inhibitors that target elements downstream of TLR signaling, we show that the TAK1→IKKβ→TPL2→MKK1/MKK2 pathway regulates IL-33 expression following an infection with P. aeruginosa. Our findings represent the first characterization of the signals regulating IL-33 expression in CF airway epithelial cells in response to a bacterial infection.",26793709,PMC4707240,10.3389/fcell.2015.00087,,2015,"Farias R, Rousseau S.",Y,MED
Enhancement of lung gene delivery after aerosol: a new strategy using non-viral complexes with antibacterial properties.,"The pathophysiology of obstructive pulmonary diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), leads to the development of chronic infections in the respiratory tract. Thus, the symptomatic management of the disease requires, in particular, repetitive antibiotherapy. Besides these antibacterial treatments, certain pathologies, such as CF or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), require the intake of many drugs. This simultaneous absorption may lead to undesirable drug interactions. For example, Orkambi® (lumacaftor/Ivacaftor, Vertex), a pharmacological drug employed to treat F508del patients, cannot be used with antibiotics such as rifampicin or rifabutin (rifamycin family) which are necessary to treat Mycobacteriaceae. As far as gene therapy is concerned, bacteria and/or biofilm in the airways present an additional barrier for gene transfer. Thus, aerosol administration of nanoparticles have to overcome many obstacles before allowing cellular penetration of therapeutic compounds. This review focusses on the development of aerosol formulations adapted to the respiratory tract and its multiple barriers. Then, formulations that are currently used in clinical applications are summarized depending on the active molecule delivered. Finally, we focus on new therapeutic approaches to reduce possible drug interactions by transferring the antibacterial activity to the nanocarrier while ensuring the transfection efficiency.",29046368,PMC5691145,10.1042/bsr20160618,,2017,"Mottais A, Le Gall T, Sibiril Y, Ravel J, Laurent V, d'Arbonneau F, Montier T.",Y,MED
Chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis in cystic fibrosis: update on diagnosis and treatment.,"Although cystic fibrosis (CF) is an irreversible genetic disease, advances in treatment have increased the life expectancy of CF patients. Upper airway involvement, which is mainly due to pathological changes in the paranasal sinuses, is prevalent in CF patients, although many are only mildly symptomatic (with few symptoms). The objective of this literature review was to discuss the pathophysiology and current therapeutic management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in CF patients. The review was based on current evidence, which was classified in accordance with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine criteria. When symptomatic, CRS with nasal polyps can affect quality of life and can lead to pulmonary exacerbations, given that the paranasal sinuses can be colonized with pathogenic bacteria, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infection with P. aeruginosa plays a crucial role in morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation in CF patients. Although clinical treatment of the upper airways is recommended as initial management, this recommendation is often extrapolated from studies of CRS in the general population. When sinonasal disease is refractory to noninvasive therapy, surgery is indicated. Further studies are needed in order to gain a better understanding of upper airway involvement and improve the management of CRS in CF patients, with the objective of preserving lung function and avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures.",25750676,PMC4350827,10.1590/s1806-37132015000100009,,2015,"Kang SH, Dalcin Pde T, Piltcher OB, Migliavacca Rde O.",Y,MED

A novel treatment of cystic fibrosis acting on-target: cysteamine plus epigallocatechin gallate for the autophagy-dependent rescue of class II-mutated CFTR.,"We previously reported that the combination of two safe proteostasis regulators, cysteamine and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), can be used to improve deficient expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in patients homozygous for the CFTR Phe508del mutation. Here we provide the proof-of-concept that this combination treatment restored CFTR function and reduced lung inflammation (P<0.001) in Phe508del/Phe508del or Phe508del/null-Cftr (but not in Cftr-null mice), provided that such mice were autophagy-competent. Primary nasal cells from patients bearing different class II CFTR mutations, either in homozygous or compound heterozygous form, responded to the treatment in vitro. We assessed individual responses to cysteamine plus EGCG in a single-centre, open-label phase-2 trial. The combination treatment decreased sweat chloride from baseline, increased both CFTR protein and function in nasal cells, restored autophagy in such cells, decreased CXCL8 and TNF-α in the sputum, and tended to improve respiratory function. These positive effects were particularly strong in patients carrying Phe508del CFTR mutations in homozygosity or heterozygosity. However, a fraction of patients bearing other CFTR mutations failed to respond to therapy. Importantly, the same patients whose primary nasal brushed cells did not respond to cysteamine plus EGCG in vitro also exhibited deficient therapeutic responses in vivo. Altogether, these results suggest that the combination treatment of cysteamine plus EGCG acts 'on-target' because it can only rescue CFTR function when autophagy is functional (in mice) and improves CFTR function when a rescuable protein is expressed (in mice and men). These results should spur the further clinical development of the combination treatment.",27035618,PMC4947669,10.1038/cdd.2016.22,,2016,"Tosco A, De Gregorio F, Esposito S, De Stefano D, Sana I, Ferrari E, Sepe A, Salvadori L, Buonpensiero P, Di Pasqua A, Grassia R, Leone CA, Guido S, De Rosa G, Lusa S, Bona G, Stoll G, Maiuri MC, Mehta A, Kroemer G, Maiuri L, Raia V.",Y,MED
Speeding Up the Identification of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator-Targeted Drugs: An Approach Based on Bioinformatics Strategies and Surface Plasmon Resonance.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is mainly caused by the deletion of Phe 508 (ΔF508) in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein that is thus withheld in the endoplasmic reticulum and rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin/proteasome system. New drugs able to rescue ΔF508-CFTR trafficking are eagerly awaited. An integrated bioinformatics and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) approach was here applied to investigate the rescue mechanism(s) of a series of CFTR-ligands including VX809, VX770 and some aminoarylthiazole derivatives (AAT). Computational studies tentatively identified a large binding pocket in the ΔF508-CFTR nucleotide binding domain-1 (NBD1) and predicted all the tested compounds to bind to three sub-regions of this main pocket. Noticeably, the known CFTR chaperone keratin-8 (K8) seems to interact with some residues located in one of these sub-pockets, potentially interfering with the binding of some ligands. SPR results corroborated all these computational findings. Moreover, for all the considered ligands, a statistically significant correlation was determined between their binding capability to ΔF508-NBD1 measured by SPR and the pockets availability measured by computational studies. Taken together, these results demonstrate a strong agreement between the in silico prediction and the SPR-generated binding data, suggesting a path to speed up the identification of new drugs for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.",29316712,PMC6017603,10.3390/molecules23010120,,2018,"Rusnati M, Sala D, Orro A, Bugatti A, Trombetti G, Cichero E, Urbinati C, Di Somma M, Millo E, Galietta LJV, Milanesi L, Fossa P, D'Ursi P.",Y,MED
Challenges Facing Airway Epithelial Cell-Based Therapy for Cystic Fibrosis.,"Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene cause the life-limiting hereditary disease, cystic fibrosis (CF). Decreased or absent functional CFTR protein in airway epithelial cells leads to abnormally viscous mucus and impaired mucociliary transport, resulting in bacterial infections and inflammation causing progressive lung damage. There are more than 2000 known variants in the *CFTR* gene. A subset of CF individuals with specific *CFTR* mutations qualify for pharmacotherapies of variable efficacy. These drugs, termed CFTR modulators, address key defects in protein folding, trafficking, abundance, and function at the apical cell membrane resulting from specific *CFTR* mutations. However, some *CFTR* mutations result in little or no CFTR mRNA or protein expression for which a pharmaceutical strategy is more challenging and remote. One approach to rescue CFTR function in the airway epithelium is to replace cells that carry a mutant *CFTR* sequence with cells that express a normal copy of the gene. Cell-based therapy theoretically has the potential to serve as a one-time cure for CF lung disease regardless of the causative *CFTR* mutation. In this review, we explore major challenges and recent progress toward this ambitious goal. The ideal therapeutic cell would: (1) be autologous to avoid the complications of rejection and immune-suppression; (2) be safely modified to express functional CFTR; (3) be expandable *ex vivo* to generate sufficient cell quantities to restore CFTR function; and (4) have the capacity to engraft, proliferate and persist long-term in recipient airways without complications. Herein, we explore human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as candidate cell therapies for CF and explore the challenges facing their delivery to the human airway.",30800069,PMC6376457,10.3389/fphar.2019.00074,,2019,"Berical A, Lee RE, Randell SH, Hawkins F.",Y,MED
Novel opportunities for CFTR-targeting drug development using organoids.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CFTR mutations lead to production of non-functional CFTR, reduced amounts of normal functioning CFTR or misfolded CFTR with defects in trafficking or function. For decades, CF treatment has been focused on the symptoms of CF, but pharmacotherapy using small molecules that target the basic defect of CF, the mutant CFTR protein, is now possible for a limited amount of subjects with CF. This raises the exciting possibility that the majority of people with CF may receive effective treatment targeting the different CFTR mutants in the future. We recently described a functional CFTR assay using rectal biopsies from subjects with CF that were cultured in vitro into self-organizing mini-guts or organoids. We here describe how this model may assist in the discovery of new CFTR-targeting drugs, the subjects that may benefit from these drugs, and the mechanisms underlying variability in CFTR genotype-phenotype relations.",25003014,PMC3915567,10.4161/rdis.27112,,2013,"Dekkers JF, van der Ent CK, Beekman JM.",Y,MED
Improved Growth Patterns in Cystic Fibrosis Mice after Loss of Histone Deacetylase 6.,"Growth failure in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients has been well-documented and shown to correlate with poorer disease outcomes. This observation is also true in CF animal models, including mouse, pig, rat, and ferret. The etiology underlying growth deficits is unknown, and our previous work demonstrated reduced tubulin acetylation in CF cell models and tissue that is correctable by inhibition of histone deacetylase-6 (HDAC6). Here, we hypothesize that loss of HDAC6 will improve growth phenotype in a CF mouse model. Hdac6 knockout mice were crossed with F508del (CF) mice to generate F508del/Hdac6 (CF/HDA) mice. Growth, fat deposits, survival, and bioelectric measurements were analyzed. CF/HDA mice displayed improvements in length and weight with no correction of CFTR function. Mechanistically, Igf1 levels likely account for increased length and improvements in fertility. Weight gain is attributed to increased fat deposits potentially mediated by increased adipocyte differentiation. CF-related growth deficits can be improved via inhibition of HDAC6, further implicating it as a potential therapeutic target for CF.",28623308,PMC5473831,10.1038/s41598-017-03931-2,,2017,"Rymut SM, Corey DA, Valerio DM, Erokwu BO, Flask CA, Kelley TJ, Hodges CA.",Y,MED
"Quorum Sensing Down-Regulation Counteracts the Negative Impact of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* on CFTR Channel Expression, Function and Rescue in Human Airway Epithelial Cells.","The function of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channels is crucial in human airways. However unfortunately, chronic *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infection has been shown to impair CFTR proteins in non-CF airway epithelial cells (AEC) and to alter the efficiency of new treatments with CFTR modulators designed to correct the basic CFTR default in AEC from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients carrying the F508del mutation. Our aim was first to compare the effect of laboratory strains, clinical isolates, engineered and natural mutants to determine the role of the LasR quorum sensing system in CFTR impairment, and second, to test the efficiency of a quorum sensing inhibitor to counteract the deleterious impact of *P. aeruginosa* both on wt-CFTR and on the rescue of F508del-CFTR by correctors. We first report that exoproducts from either the laboratory PAO1 strain or a clinical ≪Early≫ isolate (from an early stage of infection) altered CFTR expression, localization and function in AEC expressing wt-CFTR. Genetic inactivation of the quorum-sensing LasR in PAO1 (PAO1Δ*lasR*) or in a natural clinical mutant (≪Late≫ CF-adapted clinical isolate) abolished wt-CFTR impairment. PAO1 exoproducts also dampened F508del-CFTR rescue by VRT-325 or Vx-809 correctors in CF cells, whereas PAO1Δ*lasR* had no impact. Importantly, treatment of *P. aeruginosa* cultures with a quorum sensing inhibitor (HDMF) prevented the negative effect of *P. aeruginosa* exoproducts on wt-CFTR and preserved CFTR rescue by correctors in CF AEC. These findings indicate that LasR-interfering strategies could be of benefits to counteract the deleterious effect of *P. aeruginosa* in infected patients.",29177135,PMC5686086,10.3389/fcimb.2017.00470,,2017,"Maillé É, Ruffin M, Adam D, Messaoud H, Lafayette SL, McKay G, Nguyen D, Brochiero E.",Y,MED
Potentiation of ΔF508- and G551D-CFTR-Mediated Cl- Current by Novel Hydroxypyrazolines.,"The most common mutation of CFTR, affecting approximately 90% of CF patients, is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del, ΔF508). Misfolding of ΔF508-CFTR impairs both its trafficking to the plasma membrane and its chloride channel activity. To identify small molecules that can restore channel activity of ΔF508-CFTR, we synthesized and evaluated eighteen novel hydroxypyrazoline analogues as CFTR potentiators. To elucidate potentiation activities of hydroxypyrazolines for ΔF508-CFTR, CFTR activity was measured using a halide-sensitive YFP assay, Ussing chamber assay and patch-clamp technique. Compounds 7p, 7q and 7r exhibited excellent potentiation with EC50 value <10 μM. Among the compounds, 7q (a novel CFTR potentiator, CP7q) showed the highest potentiation activity with EC50 values of 0.88 ± 0.11 and 4.45 ± 0.31 μM for wild-type and ΔF508-CFTR, respectively. In addition, CP7q significantly potentiated chloride conductance of G551D-CFTR, a CFTR gating mutant; its maximal potentiation activity was 1.9 fold higher than the well-known CFTR potentiator genistein. Combination treatment with CP7q and VX-809, a corrector of ΔF508-CFTR, significantly enhanced functional rescue of ΔF508-CFTR compared with VX-809 alone. CP7q did not alter the cytosolic cAMP level and showed no cytotoxicity at the concentration showing maximum efficacy. The hydroxypyrazolines may be potential development candidates for drug therapy of cystic fibrosis.",26863533,PMC4749168,10.1371/journal.pone.0149131,,2016,"Park J, Khloya P, Seo Y, Kumar S, Lee HK, Jeon DK, Jo S, Sharma PK, Namkung W.",Y,MED
"Reduced β-Cell Secretory Capacity in Pancreatic-Insufficient, but Not Pancreatic-Sufficient, Cystic Fibrosis Despite Normal Glucose Tolerance.","Patients with pancreatic-insufficient cystic fibrosis (PI-CF) are at increased risk for developing diabetes. We determined β-cell secretory capacity and insulin secretory rates from glucose-potentiated arginine and mixed-meal tolerance tests (MMTTs), respectively, in pancreatic-sufficient cystic fibrosis (PS-CF), PI-CF, and normal control subjects, all with normal glucose tolerance, in order to identify early pathophysiologic defects. Acute islet cell secretory responses were determined under fasting, 230 mg/dL, and 340 mg/dL hyperglycemia clamp conditions. PI-CF subjects had lower acute insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon responses compared with PS-CF and normal control subjects, indicating reduced β-cell secretory capacity and α-cell function. Fasting proinsulin-to-C-peptide and proinsulin secretory ratios during glucose potentiation were higher in PI-CF, suggesting impaired proinsulin processing. In the first 30 min of the MMTT, insulin secretion was lower in PI-CF compared with PS-CF and normal control subjects, and glucagon-like peptide 1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide were lower compared with PS-CF, and after 180 min, glucose was higher in PI-CF compared with normal control subjects. These findings indicate that despite ""normal"" glucose tolerance, adolescents and adults with PI-CF have impairments in functional islet mass and associated early-phase insulin secretion, which with decreased incretin responses likely leads to the early development of postprandial hyperglycemia in CF.",27495225,PMC5204312,10.2337/db16-0394,,2017,"Sheikh S, Gudipaty L, De Leon DD, Hadjiliadis D, Kubrak C, Rosenfeld NK, Nyirjesy SC, Peleckis AJ, Malik S, Stefanovski D, Cuchel M, Rubenstein RC, Kelly A, Rickels MR.",Y,MED
International Committee on Mental Health in Cystic Fibrosis: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and European Cystic Fibrosis Society consensus statements for screening and treating depression and anxiety.,"Studies measuring psychological distress in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) have found high rates of both depression and anxiety. Psychological symptoms in both individuals with CF and parent caregivers have been associated with decreased lung function, lower body mass index, worse adherence, worse health-related quality of life, more frequent hospitalisations and increased healthcare costs. To identify and treat depression and anxiety in CF, the CF Foundation and the European CF Society invited a panel of experts, including physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, a pharmacist, parents and an individual with CF, to develop consensus recommendations for clinical care. Over 18 months, this 22-member committee was divided into four workgroups: Screening; Psychological Interventions; Pharmacological Treatments and Implementation and Future Research, and used the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome methodology to develop questions for literature search and review. Searches were conducted in PubMed, PsychINFO, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Psychiatry online and ABDATA by a methodologist at Dartmouth. The committee reviewed 344 articles, drafted statements and set an 80% acceptance for each recommendation statement as a consensus threshold prior to an anonymous voting process. Fifteen guideline recommendation statements for screening and treatment of depression and anxiety in individuals with CF and parent caregivers were finalised by vote. As these recommendations are implemented in CF centres internationally, the process of dissemination, implementation and resource provision should be closely monitored to assess barriers and concerns, validity and use.",26452630,PMC4717439,10.1136/thoraxjnl-2015-207488,,2016,"Quittner AL, Abbott J, Georgiopoulos AM, Goldbeck L, Smith B, Hempstead SE, Marshall B, Sabadosa KA, Elborn S, International Committee on Mental Health, EPOS Trial Study Group.",Y,MED
"Repeated nebulisation of non-viral CFTR gene therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial.","Background: Lung delivery of plasmid DNA encoding the CFTR gene complexed with a cationic liposome is a potential treatment option for patients with cystic fibrosis. We aimed to assess the efficacy of non-viral CFTR gene therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis.Methods: We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial in two cystic fibrosis centres with patients recruited from 18 sites in the UK. Patients (aged ≥12 years) with a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 50-90% predicted and any combination of CFTR mutations, were randomly assigned, via a computer-based randomisation system, to receive 5 mL of either nebulised pGM169/GL67A gene-liposome complex or 0.9% saline (placebo) every 28 days (plus or minus 5 days) for 1 year. Randomisation was stratified by % predicted FEV1 (<70 vs ≥70%), age (<18 vs ≥18 years), inclusion in the mechanistic substudy, and dosing site (London or Edinburgh). Participants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the relative change in % predicted FEV1. The primary analysis was per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01621867.Findings: Between June 12, 2012, and June 24, 2013, we randomly assigned 140 patients to receive placebo (n=62) or pGM169/GL67A (n=78), of whom 116 (83%) patients comprised the per-protocol population. We noted a significant, albeit modest, treatment effect in the pGM169/GL67A group versus placebo at 12 months' follow-up (3.7%, 95% CI 0.1-7.3; p=0.046). This outcome was associated with a stabilisation of lung function in the pGM169/GL67A group compared with a decline in the placebo group. We recorded no significant difference in treatment-attributable adverse events between groups.Interpretation: Monthly application of the pGM169/GL67A gene therapy formulation was associated with a significant, albeit modest, benefit in FEV1 compared with placebo at 1 year, indicating a stabilisation of lung function in the treatment group.

Mechanistic Approaches to Improve Correction of the Most Common Disease-Causing Mutation in Cystic Fibrosis.,"The most common mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene leads to deletion of the phenylalanine at position 508 (ΔF508) in the CFTR protein and causes multiple folding and functional defects. Contrary to large-scale efforts by industry and academia, no significant therapeutic benefit has been achieved with a single ""corrector"". Therefore, investigations concentrate on drug combinations. Orkambi (Vertex Pharmaceuticals), the first FDA-approved drug for treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) caused by this mutation, is a combination of a corrector (VX-809) that facilitates ΔF508 CFTR biogenesis and a potentiator (VX-770), which improves its function. Yet, clinical trials utilizing this combination showed only modest therapeutic benefit. The low efficacy Orkambi has been attributed to VX-770-mediated destabilization of VX-809-rescued ΔF508 CFTR. Here we report that the negative effects of VX-770 can be reversed by increasing the half-life of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) form (band B) of ΔF508 CFTR with another corrector (Corr-4a.) Although Corr-4a alone has only minimal effects on ΔF508 CFTR rescue, it increases the half-life of ΔF508 CFTR band B when it is present during half-life measurements. Our data shows that stabilization of band B ΔF508 CFTR with Corr-4a and simultaneous rescue with VX-809, leads to a >2-fold increase in cAMP-activated, CFTRinh-172-inhibited currents compared to VX-809 alone, or VX-809+VX-770. The negative effects of VX-770 and the Corr-4a protection are specific to the native I507-ATT ΔF508 CFTR without affecting the inherently more stable, synonymous variant I507-ATC ΔF508 CFTR. Our studies emphasize that stabilization of ΔF508 CFTR band B in the ER might improve its functional rescue by Orkambi.",27214033,PMC4877091,10.1371/journal.pone.0155882,,2016,"Bali V, Lazrak A, Guroji P, Matalon S, Bebok Z.",Y,MED
Precision medicine via the integration of phenotype-genotype information in neonatal genome project.,"The explosion of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled the widespread use of genomic data in precision medicine. Currently, several neonatal genome projects have emerged to explore the advantages of NGS to diagnose or screen for rare genetic disorders. These projects have made remarkable achievements, but still the genome data could be further explored with the assistance of phenotype collection. In contrast, longitudinal birth cohorts are great examples to record and apply phenotypic information in clinical studies starting at the neonatal period, especially the trajectory analyses for health development or disease progression. It is obvious that efficient integration of genotype and phenotype benefits not only the clinical management of rare genetic disorders but also the risk assessment of complex diseases. Here, we first summarize the recent neonatal genome projects as well as some longitudinal birth cohorts. Then, we propose two simplified strategies by integrating genotypic and phenotypic information in precision medicine based on current studies. Finally, research collaborations, sociological issues, and future perspectives are discussed. How to maximize neonatal genomic information to benefit the pediatric population remains an area in need of more research and effort.",38933389,PMC11197532,10.1016/j.fmre.2022.07.003,,2022,"Dong X, Xiao T, Chen B, Lu Y, Zhou W.",Y,MED
The EGFR-ADAM17 Axis in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Cystic Fibrosis Lung Pathology.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) share molecular mechanisms that cause the pathological symptoms they have in common. Here, we review evidence suggesting that hyperactivity of the EGFR/ADAM17 axis plays a role in the development of chronic lung disease in both CF and COPD. The ubiquitous transmembrane protease A disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) forms a functional unit with the EGF receptor (EGFR), in a feedback loop interaction labeled the ADAM17/EGFR axis. In airway epithelial cells, ADAM17 sheds multiple soluble signaling proteins by proteolysis, including EGFR ligands such as amphiregulin (AREG), and proinflammatory mediators such as the interleukin 6 coreceptor (IL-6R). This activity can be enhanced by injury, toxins, and receptor-mediated external triggers. In addition to intracellular kinases, the extracellular glutathione-dependent redox potential controls ADAM17 shedding. Thus, the epithelial ADAM17/EGFR axis serves as a receptor of incoming luminal stress signals, relaying these to neighboring and underlying cells, which plays an important role in the resolution of lung injury and inflammation. We review evidence that congenital CFTR deficiency in CF and reduced CFTR activity in chronic COPD may cause enhanced ADAM17/EGFR signaling through a defect in glutathione secretion. In future studies, these complex interactions and the options for pharmaceutical interventions will be further investigated.",29540993,PMC5818912,10.1155/2018/1067134,,2018,"Stolarczyk M, Scholte BJ.",Y,MED
High-Throughput Screening for Modulators of CFTR Activity Based on Genetically Engineered Cystic Fibrosis Disease-Specific iPSCs.,"Organotypic culture systems from disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) exhibit obvious advantages compared with immortalized cell lines and primary cell cultures, but implementation of iPSC-based high-throughput (HT) assays is still technically challenging. Here, we demonstrate the development and conduction of an organotypic HT Cl-/I- exchange assay using cystic fibrosis (CF) disease-specific iPSCs. The introduction of a halide-sensitive YFP variant enabled automated quantitative measurement of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) function in iPSC-derived intestinal epithelia. CFTR function was partially rescued by treatment with VX-770 and VX-809, and seamless gene correction of the p.Phe508del mutation resulted in full restoration of CFTR function. The identification of a series of validated primary hits that improve the function of p.Phe508del CFTR from a library of ∼42,500 chemical compounds demonstrates that the advantages of complex iPSC-derived culture systems for disease modeling can also be utilized for drug screening in a true HT format.",31080112,PMC6565754,10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.04.014,,2019,"Merkert S, Schubert M, Olmer R, Engels L, Radetzki S, Veltman M, Scholte BJ, Zöllner J, Pedemonte N, Galietta LJV, von Kries JP, Martin U.",Y,MED
Genotypic Diversity within a Single Pseudomonas aeruginosa Strain Commonly Shared by Australian Patients with Cystic Fibrosis.,"In cystic fibrosis (CF), Pseudomonas aeruginosa undergoes intra-strain genotypic and phenotypic diversification while establishing and maintaining chronic lung infections. As the clinical significance of these changes is uncertain, we investigated intra-strain diversity in commonly shared strains from CF patients to determine if specific gene mutations were associated with increased antibiotic resistance and worse clinical outcomes. Two-hundred-and-one P. aeruginosa isolates (163 represented a dominant Australian shared strain, AUST-02) from two Queensland CF centres over two distinct time-periods (2001-2002 and 2007-2009) underwent mexZ and lasR sequencing. Broth microdilution antibiotic susceptibility testing in a subset of isolates was also performed. We identified a novel AUST-02 subtype (M3L7) in adults attending a single Queensland CF centre. This M3L7 subtype was multi-drug resistant and had significantly higher antibiotic minimum inhibitory concentrations than other AUST-02 subtypes. Prospective molecular surveillance using polymerase chain reaction assays determined the prevalence of the 'M3L7' subtype at this centre during 2007-2009 (170 patients) and 2011 (173 patients). Three-year clinical outcomes of patients harbouring different strains and subtypes were compared. MexZ and LasR sequences from AUST-02 isolates were more likely in 2007-2009 than 2001-2002 to exhibit mutations (mexZ: odds ratio (OR) = 3.8; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-13.5 and LasR: OR = 2.5; 95%CI: 1.3-5.0). Surveillance at the adult centre in 2007-2009 identified M3L7 in 28/509 (5.5%) P. aeruginosa isolates from 13/170 (7.6%) patients. A repeat survey in 2011 identified M3L7 in 21/519 (4.0%) P. aeruginosa isolates from 11/173 (6.4%) patients. The M3L7 subtype was associated with greater intravenous antibiotic and hospitalisation requirements, and a higher 3-year risk of death/lung transplantation, than other AUST-02 subtypes (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 9.4; 95%CI: 2.2-39.2) and non-AUST-02 strains (adjusted HR = 4.8; 95%CI: 1.4-16.2).

Optimizing nasal potential difference analysis for CFTR modulator development: assessment of ivacaftor in CF subjects with the G551D-CFTR mutation.,"Nasal potential difference (NPD) is used as a biomarker of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity. We evaluated methods to detect changes in chloride and sodium transport by NPD based on a secondary analysis of a Phase II CFTR-modulator study. Thirty-nine subjects with CF who also had the G551D-CFTR mutation were randomized to receive ivacaftor (Kalydeco™; also known as VX-770) in four doses or placebo twice daily for at least 14 days. All data were analyzed by a single investigator who was blinded to treatment assignment. We compared three analysis methods to determine the best approach to quantify changes in chloride and sodium transport: (1) the average of both nostrils; (2) the most-polarized nostril at each visit; and (3) the most-polarized nostril at screening carried forward. Parameters of ion transport included the PD change with zero chloride plus isoproterenol (CFTR activity), the basal PD, Ringer's PD, and change in PD with amiloride (measurements of ENaC activity), and the delta NPD (measuring CFTR and ENaC activity). The average and most-polarized nostril at each visit were most sensitive to changes in chloride and sodium transport, whereas the most-polarized nostril at screening carried forward was less discriminatory. Based on our findings, NPD studies should assess both nostrils rather than a single nostril. We also found that changes in CFTR activity were more readily detected than changes in ENaC activity, and that rigorous standardization was associated with relatively good within-subject reproducibility in placebo-treated subjects (± 2.8 mV). Therefore, we have confirmed an assay of reasonable reproducibility for detecting chloride-transport improvements in response to CFTR modulation.",23922647,PMC3724869,10.1371/journal.pone.0066955,,2013,"Rowe SM, Liu B, Hill A, Hathorne H, Cohen M, Beamer JR, Accurso FJ, Dong Q, Ordoñez CL, Stone AJ, Olson ER, Clancy JP, VX06-770-101 Study Group.",Y,MED
High-Content Surface and Total Expression siRNA Kinase Library Screen with VX-809 Treatment Reveals Kinase Targets that Enhance F508del-CFTR Rescue.,"The most promising F508del-CFTR corrector, VX-809, has been unsuccessful as an effective, stand-alone treatment for CF patients, but the rescue effect in combination with other drugs may confer an acceptable level of therapeutic benefit. Targeting cellular factors that modify trafficking may act to enhance the cell surface density of F508-CFTR with VX-809 correction. Our goal is to identify druggable kinases that enhance F508del-CFTR rescue and stabilization at the cell surface beyond that achievable with the VX-809 corrector alone. To achieve this goal, we implemented a new high-throughput screening paradigm that quickly and quantitatively measures surface density and total protein in the same cells. This allowed for rapid screening for increased surface targeting and proteostatic regulation. The assay utilizes fluorogen-activating-protein (FAP) technology with cell excluded and cell permeant fluorogenic dyes in a quick, wash-free fluorescent plate reader format on live cells to first measure F508del-CFTR expressed on the surface and then the total amount of F508del-CFTR protein present. To screen for kinase targets, we used Dharmacon's ON-TARGET plus SMARTpool siRNA Kinase library (715 target kinases) with and without 10 μM VX-809 treatment in triplicate at 37 °C. We identified several targets that had a significant interaction with VX-809 treatment in enhancing surface density with siRNA knockdown. Select small-molecule inhibitors of the kinase targets demonstrated augmented surface expression with VX-809 treatment.",29384380,PMC5844356,10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b00928,,2018,"Perkins LA, Fisher GW, Naganbabu M, Schmidt BF, Mun F, Bruchez MP.",Y,MED
Pseudomonas aeruginosa Reduces VX-809 Stimulated F508del-CFTR Chloride Secretion by Airway Epithelial Cells.,"Background: P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that chronically infects the lungs of 85% of adult patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Previously, we demonstrated that P. aeruginosa reduced wt-CFTR Cl secretion by airway epithelial cells. Recently, a new investigational drug VX-809 has been shown to increase F508del-CFTR Cl secretion in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, and, in combination with VX-770, to increase FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) by an average of 3-5% in CF patients homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. We propose that P. aeruginosa infection of CF lungs reduces VX-809 + VX-770- stimulated F508del-CFTR Cl secretion, and thereby reduces the clinical efficacy of VX-809 + VX-770.Methods and results: F508del-CFBE cells and primary cultures of CF-HBE cells (F508del/F508del) were exposed to VX-809 alone or a combination of VX-809 + VX-770 for 48 hours and the effect of P. aeruginosa on F508del-CFTR Cl secretion was measured in Ussing chambers. The effect of VX-809 on F508del-CFTR abundance was measured by cell surface biotinylation and western blot analysis. PAO1, PA14, PAK and 6 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa (3 mucoid and 3 non-mucoid) significantly reduced drug stimulated F508del-CFTR Cl secretion, and plasma membrane F508del-CFTR.Conclusion: The observation that P. aeruginosa reduces VX-809 and VX-809 + VX-770 stimulated F508del CFTR Cl secretion may explain, in part, why VX-809 + VX-770 has modest efficacy in clinical trials.",26018799,PMC4446214,10.1371/journal.pone.0127742,,2015,"Stanton BA, Coutermarsh B, Barnaby R, Hogan D.",Y,MED
Organoid based personalized medicine: from bench to bedside.,"Three-dimensional cultured organoids have become a powerful in vitro research tool that preserves genetic, phenotypic and behavioral trait of in vivo organs, which can be established from both pluripotent stem cells and adult stem cells. Organoids derived from adult stem cells can be established directly from diseased epithelium and matched normal tissues, and organoids can also be genetically manipulated by CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Applications of organoids in basic research involve the modeling of human development and diseases, including genetic, infectious and malignant diseases. Importantly, accumulating evidence suggests that biobanks of patient-derived organoids for many cancers and cystic fibrosis have great value for drug development and personalized medicine. In addition, organoids hold promise for regenerative medicine. In the present review, we discuss the applications of organoids in the basic and translational research.",33135109,PMC7603915,10.1186/s13619-020-00059-z,,2020,"Li Y, Tang P, Cai S, Peng J, Hua G.",Y,MED

Gap Junctions Are Involved in the Rescue of CFTR-Dependent Chloride Efflux by Amniotic Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Coculture with Cystic Fibrosis CFBE41o- Cells.,"We previously found that human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) in coculture with CF immortalised airway epithelial cells (CFBE41o- line, CFBE) on Transwell® filters acquired an epithelial phenotype and led to the expression of a mature and functional CFTR protein. In order to explore the role of gap junction- (GJ-) mediated intercellular communication (GJIC) in this rescue, cocultures (hAMSC : CFBE, 1 : 5 ratio) were studied for the formation of GJIC, before and after silencing connexin 43 (Cx43), a major component of GJs. Functional GJs in cocultures were inhibited when the expression of the Cx43 protein was downregulated. Transfection of cocultures with siRNA against Cx43 resulted in the absence of specific CFTR signal on the apical membrane and reduction in the mature form of CFTR (band C), and in parallel, the CFTR-dependent chloride channel activity was significantly decreased. Cx43 downregulation determined also a decrease in transepithelial resistance and an increase in paracellular permeability as compared with control cocultures, implying that GJIC may regulate CFTR expression and function that in turn modulate airway epithelium tightness. These results indicate that GJIC is involved in the correction of CFTR chloride channel activity upon the acquisition of an epithelial phenotype by hAMSCs in coculture with CF cells.",29531530,PMC5821953,10.1155/2018/1203717,,2018,"Carbone A, Zefferino R, Beccia E, Casavola V, Castellani S, Di Gioia S, Giannone V, Seia M, Angiolillo A, Colombo C, Favia M, Conese M.",Y,MED

Stabilizing rescued surface-localized δf508 CFTR by potentiation of its interaction with Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 1.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in CFTR, a plasma-membrane-localized anion channel. The most common mutation in CFTR, deletion of phenylalanine at residue 508 (ΔF508), causes misfolding of CFTR resulting in little or no protein at the plasma membrane. The CFTR corrector VX-809 shows promise for treating CF patients homozygous for ΔF508. Here, we demonstrate the significance of protein-protein interactions in enhancing the stability of the ΔF508 CFTR mutant channel protein at the plasma membrane. We determined that VX-809 prolongs the stability of ΔF508 CFTR at the plasma membrane. Using competition-based assays, we demonstrated that ΔF508 CFTR interacts poorly with Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) compared to wild-type CFTR, and VX-809 significantly increased this binding affinity. We conclude that stabilized CFTR-NHERF1 interaction is a determinant of the functional efficiency of rescued ΔF508 CFTR. Our results demonstrate the importance of macromolecular-complex formation in stabilizing rescued mutant CFTR at the plasma membrane and suggest this to be foundational for the development of a new generation of effective CFTR-corrector-based therapeutics.",24945463,PMC4081048,10.1021/bi401263h,,2014,"Arora K, Moon C, Zhang W, Yarlagadda S, Penmatsa H, Ren A, Sinha C, Naren AP.",Y,MED
GBA2-encoded β-glucosidase activity is involved in the inflammatory response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,"Current anti-inflammatory strategies for the treatment of pulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) are limited; thus, there is continued interest in identifying additional molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Given the emerging role of sphingolipids (SLs) in various respiratory disorders, including CF, drugs that selectively target the enzymes associated with SL metabolism are under development. Miglustat, a well-characterized iminosugar-based inhibitor of β-glucosidase 2 (GBA2), has shown promise in CF treatment because it reduces the inflammatory response to infection by P. aeruginosa and restores F508del-CFTR chloride channel activity. This study aimed to probe the molecular basis for the anti-inflammatory activity of miglustat by examining specifically the role of GBA2 following the infection of CF bronchial epithelial cells by P. aeruginosa. We also report the anti-inflammatory activity of another potent inhibitor of GBA2 activity, namely N-(5-adamantane-1-yl-methoxy)pentyl)-deoxynojirimycin (Genz-529648). In CF bronchial cells, inhibition of GBA2 by miglustat or Genz-529648 significantly reduced the induction of IL-8 mRNA levels and protein release following infection by P. aeruginosa. Hence, the present data demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory effects of miglustat and Genz-529648 are likely exerted through inhibition of GBA2.",25141135,PMC4139313,10.1371/journal.pone.0104763,,2014,"Loberto N, Tebon M, Lampronti I, Marchetti N, Aureli M, Bassi R, Giri MG, Bezzerri V, Lovato V, Cantù C, Munari S, Cheng SH, Cavazzini A, Gambari R, Sonnino S, Cabrini G, Dechecchi MC.",Y,MED
"SLC6A14, an amino acid transporter, modifies the primary CF defect in fluid secretion.","The severity of intestinal disease associated with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is variable in the patient population and this variability is partially conferred by the influence of modifier genes. Genome-wide association studies have identified *SLC6A14,* an electrogenic amino acid transporter, as a genetic modifier of CF-associated meconium ileus. The purpose of the current work was to determine the biological role of *Slc6a14,* by disrupting its expression in CF mice bearing the major mutation, F508del. We found that disruption of *Slc6a14* worsened the intestinal fluid secretion defect, characteristic of these mice. In vitro studies of mouse intestinal organoids revealed that exacerbation of the primary defect was associated with reduced arginine uptake across the apical membrane, with aberrant nitric oxide and cyclic GMP-mediated regulation of the major CF-causing mutant protein. Together, these studies highlight the role of this apical transporter in modifying cellular nitric oxide levels, residual function of the major CF mutant and potentially, its promise as a therapeutic target.",30004386,PMC6054531,10.7554/elife.37963,,2018,"Ahmadi S, Xia S, Wu YS, Di Paola M, Kissoon R, Luk C, Lin F, Du K, Rommens J, Bear CE.",Y,MED
Organoid Technology: A Reliable Developmental Biology Tool for Organ-Specific Nanotoxicity Evaluation.,"Engineered nanomaterials are bestowed with certain inherent physicochemical properties unlike their parent materials, rendering them suitable for the multifaceted needs of state-of-the-art biomedical, and pharmaceutical applications. The log-phase development of nano-science along with improved ""bench to beside"" conversion carries an enhanced probability of human exposure with numerous nanoparticles. Thus, toxicity assessment of these novel nanoscale materials holds a key to ensuring the safety aspects or else the global biome will certainly face a debacle. The toxicity may span from health hazards due to direct exposure to indirect means through food chain contamination or environmental pollution, even causing genotoxicity. Multiple ways of nanotoxicity evaluation include several *in vitro* and *in vivo* methods, with *in vitro* methods occupying the bulk of the ""experimental space."" The underlying reason may be multiple, but ethical constraints in *in vivo* animal experiments are a significant one. Two-dimensional (2D) monoculture is undoubtedly the most exploited *in vitro* method providing advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness, high throughput, and reproducibility. However, it often fails to mimic a tissue or organ which possesses a defined three-dimensional structure (3D) along with intercellular communication machinery. Instead, microtissues such as spheroids or organoids having a precise 3D architecture and proximate *in vivo* tissue-like behavior can provide a more realistic evaluation than 2D monocultures. Recent developments in microfluidics and bioreactor-based organoid synthesis have eased the difficulties to prosper nano-toxicological analysis in organoid models surpassing the obstacle of ethical issues. The present review will enlighten applications of organoids in nanotoxicological evaluation, their advantages, and prospects toward securing commonplace nano-interventions.",34631696,PMC8495170,10.3389/fcell.2021.696668,,2021,"Prasad M, Kumar R, Buragohain L, Kumari A, Ghosh M.",Y,MED
Role of CFTR in epithelial physiology.,"Salt and fluid absorption and secretion are two processes that are fundamental to epithelial function and whole body fluid homeostasis, and as such are tightly regulated in epithelial tissues. The CFTR anion channel plays a major role in regulating both secretion and absorption in a diverse range of epithelial tissues, including the airways, the GI and reproductive tracts, sweat and salivary glands. It is not surprising then that defects in CFTR function are linked to disease, including life-threatening secretory diarrhoeas, such as cholera, as well as the inherited disease, cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common life-limiting genetic diseases in Caucasian populations. More recently, CFTR dysfunction has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the hyper-responsiveness in asthma, underscoring its fundamental role in whole body health and disease. CFTR regulates many mechanisms in epithelial physiology, such as maintaining epithelial surface hydration and regulating luminal pH. Indeed, recent studies have identified luminal pH as an important arbiter of epithelial barrier function and innate defence, particularly in the airways and GI tract. In this chapter, we will illustrate the different operational roles of CFTR in epithelial function by describing its characteristics in three different tissues: the airways, the pancreas, and the sweat gland.",27714410,PMC5209439,10.1007/s00018-016-2391-y,,2017,"Saint-Criq V, Gray MA.",Y,MED
"Chitosan in Non-Viral Gene Delivery: Role of Structure, Characterization Methods, and Insights in Cancer and Rare Diseases Therapies.","Non-viral gene delivery vectors have lagged far behind viral ones in the current pipeline of clinical trials of gene therapy nanomedicines. Even when non-viral nanovectors pose less safety risks than do viruses, their efficacy is much lower. Since the early studies to deliver pDNA, chitosan has been regarded as a highly attractive biopolymer to deliver nucleic acids intracellularly and induce a transgenic response resulting in either upregulation of protein expression (for pDNA, mRNA) or its downregulation (for siRNA or microRNA). This is explained as the consequence of a multi-step process involving condensation of nucleic acids, protection against degradation, stabilization in physiological conditions, cellular internalization, release from the endolysosome (""proton sponge"" effect), unpacking and enabling the trafficking of pDNA to the nucleus or the siRNA to the RNA interference silencing complex (RISC). Given the multiple steps and complexity involved in the gene transfection process, there is a dearth of understanding of the role of chitosan's structural features (*M*w and degree of acetylation, DA%) on each step that dictates the net transfection efficiency and its kinetics. The use of fully characterized chitosan samples along with the utilization of complementary biophysical and biological techniques is key to bridging this gap of knowledge and identifying the optimal chitosans for delivering a specific gene. Other aspects such as cell type and administration route are also at play. At the same time, the role of chitosan structural features on the morphology, size and surface composition of synthetic virus-like particles has barely been addressed. The ongoing revolution brought about by the recent discovery of CRISPR-Cas9 technology will undoubtedly be a game changer in this field in the short term. In the field of rare diseases, gene therapy is perhaps where the greatest potential lies and we anticipate that chitosans will be key players in the translation of research to the clinic.",30966479,PMC6415274,10.3390/polym10040444,,2018,"Santos-Carballal B, Fernández Fernández E, Goycoolea FM.",Y,MED
VX-809 corrects folding defects in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein through action on membrane-spanning domain 1.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal genetic disorder associated with defective hydration of lung airways due to the loss of chloride transport through the CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR). CFTR contains two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs), two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), and a regulatory domain, and its channel assembly requires multiple interdomain contacts. The most common CF-causing mutation, F508del, occurs in NBD1 and results in misfolding and premature degradation of F508del-CFTR. VX-809 is an investigational CFTR corrector that partially restores CFTR function in people who are homozygous for F508del-CFTR. To identify the folding defect(s) in F508del-CFTR that must be repaired to treat CF, we explored the mechanism of VX-809 action. VX-809 stabilized an N-terminal domain in CFTR that contains only MSD1 and efficaciously restored function to CFTR forms that have missense mutations in MSD1. The action of VX-809 on MSD1 appears to suppress folding defects in F508del-CFTR by enhancing interactions among the NBD1, MSD1, and MSD2 domains. The ability of VX-809 to correct F508del-CFTR is enhanced when combined with mutations that improve F508del-NBD1 interaction with MSD2. These data suggest that the use of VX-809 in combination with an additional CFTR corrector that suppresses folding defects downstream of MSD1 may further enhance CFTR function in people with F508del-CFTR.",23924900,PMC3784376,10.1091/mbc.e13-05-0240,,2013,"Ren HY, Grove DE, De La Rosa O, Houck SA, Sopha P, Van Goor F, Hoffman BJ, Cyr DM, Cyr DM.",Y,MED
Unravelling druggable signalling networks that control F508del-CFTR proteostasis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The most frequent mutation (F508del-CFTR) results in altered proteostasis, that is, in the misfolding and intracellular degradation of the protein. The F508del-CFTR proteostasis machinery and its homeostatic regulation are well studied, while the question whether 'classical' signalling pathways and phosphorylation cascades might control proteostasis remains barely explored. Here, we have unravelled signalling cascades acting selectively on the F508del-CFTR folding-trafficking defects by analysing the mechanisms of action of F508del-CFTR proteostasis regulator drugs through an approach based on transcriptional profiling followed by deconvolution of their gene signatures. Targeting multiple components of these signalling pathways resulted in potent and specific correction of F508del-CFTR proteostasis and in synergy with pharmacochaperones. These results provide new insights into the physiology of cellular proteostasis and a rational basis for developing effective pharmacological correctors of the F508del-CFTR defect.",26701908,PMC4749566,10.7554/elife.10365,,2015,"Hegde RN, Parashuraman S, Iorio F, Ciciriello F, Capuani F, Carissimo A, Carrella D, Belcastro V, Subramanian A, Bounti L, Persico M, Carlile G, Galietta L, Thomas DY, Di Bernardo D, Luini A.",Y,MED
Clinical Perspectives on Targeting Therapies for Personalized Medicine.,"Expected benefits from new technology include more efficient patient selection for clinical trials, more cost-effective treatment pathways for patients and health services and a more profitable accelerated approach for drug developers.

ΔF508 CFTR surface stability is regulated by DAB2 and CHIP-mediated ubiquitination in post-endocytic compartments.,"The ΔF508 mutant form of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (ΔF508 CFTR) that is normally degraded by the ER-associated degradative pathway can be rescued to the cell surface through low-temperature (27°C) culture or small molecular corrector treatment. However, it is unstable on the cell surface, and rapidly internalized and targeted to the lysosomal compartment for degradation. To understand the mechanism of this rapid turnover, we examined the role of two adaptor complexes (AP-2 and Dab2) and three E3 ubiquitin ligases (c-Cbl, CHIP, and Nedd4-2) on low-temperature rescued ΔF508 CFTR endocytosis and degradation in human airway epithelial cells. Our results demonstrate that siRNA depletion of either AP-2 or Dab2 inhibits ΔF508 CFTR endocytosis by 69% and 83%, respectively. AP-2 or Dab2 depletion also increases the rescued protein half-life of ΔF508 CFTR by ~18% and ~91%, respectively. In contrast, the depletion of each of the E3 ligases had no effect on ΔF508 CFTR endocytosis, whereas CHIP depletion significantly increased the surface half-life of ΔF508 CFTR. To determine where and when the ubiquitination occurs during ΔF508 CFTR turnover, we monitored the ubiquitination of rescued ΔF508 CFTR during the time course of CFTR endocytosis. Our results indicate that ubiquitination of the surface pool of ΔF508 CFTR begins to increase 15 min after internalization, suggesting that CFTR is ubiquitinated in a post-endocytic compartment. This post-endocytic ubiquination of ΔF508 CFTR could be blocked by either inhibiting endocytosis, by siRNA knockdown of CHIP, or by treating cells with the CFTR corrector, VX-809. Our results indicate that the post-endocytic ubiquitination of CFTR by CHIP is a critical step in the peripheral quality control of cell surface ΔF508 CFTR.",25879443,PMC4399842,10.1371/journal.pone.0123131,,2015,"Fu L, Rab A, Tang Lp, Bebok Z, Rowe SM, Bartoszewski R, Collawn JF.",Y,MED
Folding and Misfolding of Human Membrane Proteins in Health and Disease: From Single Molecules to Cellular Proteostasis.,"Advances over the past 25 years have revealed much about how the structural properties of membranes and associated proteins are linked to the thermodynamics and kinetics of membrane protein (MP) folding. At the same time biochemical progress has outlined how cellular proteostasis networks mediate MP folding and manage misfolding in the cell. When combined with results from genomic sequencing, these studies have established paradigms for how MP folding and misfolding are linked to the molecular etiologies of a variety of diseases. This emerging framework has paved the way for the development of a new class of small molecule ""pharmacological chaperones"" that bind to and stabilize misfolded MP variants, some of which are now in clinical use. In this review, we comprehensively outline current perspectives on the folding and misfolding of integral MPs as well as the mechanisms of cellular MP quality control. Based on these perspectives, we highlight new opportunities for innovations that bridge our molecular understanding of the energetics of MP folding with the nuanced complexity of biological systems. Given the many linkages between MP misfolding and human disease, we also examine some of the exciting opportunities to leverage these advances to address emerging challenges in the development of therapeutics and precision medicine.",30608666,PMC6506414,10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00532,,2019,"Marinko JT, Huang H, Penn WD, Capra JA, Schlebach JP, Sanders CR.",Y,MED
