Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis Patients Homozygous for F508del with Lumacaftor-Ivacaftor (Orkambi®) Restores Defective CFTR Channel Function in Circulating Mononuclear Cells,"The treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients homozygous for the F508del mutation with Orkambi®, a combination of a corrector (lumacaftor) and a potentiator (ivacaftor) of the mutated CFTR protein, resulted in some amelioration of the respiratory function. However, a great variability in the clinical response was also observed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the response to Orkambi® in a small cohort of F508del/F508del patients (n = 14) in terms of clinical and laboratory parameters, including ex vivo CFTR activity in mononuclear cells (MNCs), during a 12-month treatment. Patients responded with an increase in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1%) and body mass index (BMI) as well as with a decrease in white blood cell (WBC) total counts and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, although not significantly. Sweat chloride and CFTR-dependent chloride efflux were found to decrease and increase, respectively, as compared with pre-therapy values. CFTR and BMI showed a statistically significant correlation during Orkambi® treatment. Clustering analysis showed that CFTR, BMI, sweat chloride, FEV1%, and WBC were strongly associated. These data support the notion that CFTR-dependent chloride efflux in MNCs should be investigated as a sensitive outcome measure of Orkambi® treatment in CF patients.",10.3390/ijms21072398,32244302.0,"Favia M, Gallo C, Guerra L, De Venuto D, Diana A, Polizzi AM, Montemurro P, Mariggiò MA, Leonetti G, Manca A, Casavola V, Conese M.

Introduction of Ivacaftor/Lumacaftor in Children With Cystic Fibrosis Homozygous for F508del in the Netherlands: A Nationwide Real‐Life Study,"Introduction: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor (lum/iva) was introduced in the Netherlands in 2017. We investigated 1‐year efficacy of lum/iva on lung function and small airway and structural lung disease evaluated by multiple breath nitrogen washout and CT scan. Additionally, we investigated effects of lum/iva on exacerbations, anthropometry, sweat chloride and safety in children with CF in the Netherlands. Methods: Children with CF aged 6−18 years and homozygous for F508del treated in one of the seven Dutch CF centers for at least 12 months were eligible. Data were extracted from the Dutch CF Registry and electronic patient records. Primary outcome was change in percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) after 12 months. Results: Nationwide, 247 children with CF were eligible for lum/iva. Eight patients discontinued lum/iva due to side effects. In total, 223/247 children (90.3%) were evaluated. Mean (range) age at baseline was 11.0 (6.0−17.1) years. There was no change in FEV1 after 12 months of lum/iva. In a subgroup, markers of small airway function and structural lung disease, such as LCI (n = 28), mean change (SD) −10.0% (15.8), and bronchus‐artery (BA) analysis on CT scan (n = 81), showed significant improvement (p < 0.01). Moreover, BMI (n = 192), exacerbations (n = 219) and sweat chloride measurements (n = 105) improved. Conclusion: Lum/iva was generally well tolerated in a real‐life, nationwide pediatric cohort. The efficacy of lum/iva was comparable to phase 3 studies in children. LCI and BA analysis as markers of small airway and structural lung disease showed significant improvement which indicates the importance of these parameters to evaluate treatment effects of CF modulators in children.",10.1002/ppul.27473,39785291.0,"Zwitserloot AM, Aziz SZ, Chen Y, Bannier MAGE, Janssens HM, Merkus PFJM, Nuijsink M, Terheggen-Lagro SWJ, Tiddens HAWM, Zomer-van Ommen DD, Vonk JM, de Winter-de Groot KM, Willemse BWM, Koppelman GH.

"Short-term effects of Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor (Orkambi™) on exertional symptoms, exercise performance, and ventilatory responses in adults with cystic fibrosis","Rationale: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) modestly improves lung function following 1 month of treatment but it is unknown if this translates into improvements in exercise endurance and exertional symptoms, Methods: Adult CF participants completed a symptom-limited constant load cycling test with simultaneous assessments of dyspnea and leg discomfort ratings pre- and 1 month post-initiation of LUM/IVA, Results: Endurance time, exertional dyspnea and leg discomfort ratings at submaximal exercise did not change significantly, there was a significant inverse correlation between changes in leg discomfort and endurance time (r = − 0.88; p = 0.009) following 1-month of LUM/IVA, Conclusions: Overall, 1-month of LUM/IVA did not increase endurance time or modify exertional dyspnea or leg discomfort ratings, however, individuals who experienced a reduction in leg discomfort following LUM/IVA had an improvement in endurance time, future studies with a larger sample size are needed to verify these findings and to assess the long-term effects of LUM/IVA on exercise outcomes.",10.1186/s12931-020-01406-z,32487229.0,"Quon BS, Ramsook AH, Dhillon SS, Mitchell RA, Boyle KG, Wilcox PG, Guenette JA.

Corticosteroid use and increased CXCR2 levels on leukocytes are associated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor discontinuation in cystic fibrosis patients homozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-shortening genetic disease and is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Several current therapies aim at improving availability and/or function of the mutant CFTR proteins. The combination therapeutic lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi, luma/iva) partially corrects folding and potentiates CFTR function impaired by the F508del mutation. Despite the potential for clinical benefit, a substantial number of patients discontinue treatment due to intolerable adverse effects. The aim of the present study is to identify differences between individuals who continued treatment and those who discontinued due to adverse respiratory effects to potentially inform treatment decisions. Clinical data from the year prior to treatment initiation were analyzed from 82 patients homozygous for the F508del mutation treated at the Colorado Adult CF Program. Blood samples were collected from 30 of these subjects before initiation of treatment to examine expression of circulating leukocyte surface antigens and cytokines. Clinical and demographic characteristics were analyzed along with inflammatory markers to determine biomarkers of drug discontinuation. The use of oral prednisone and/or nasal budesonide in the year prior to luma/iva initiation was more prevalent in CF subjects who did not tolerate luma/iva (82% vs. 43%). Increased age, but not gender or initial lung function, was associated with higher probability of discontinuing treatment due to side effects overall. Worse lung function (lower ppFEV1, ppFEF25-75 ≤ 60%) was associated with higher incidence of discontinuing treatment due to pulmonary adverse effects. In a nested cohort of patients, increased surface levels of CXCR2 on CD14+CD16- monocytes were associated with discontinuation. Overall, the patients who tolerated luma/iva were distinguishable from those who did not tolerate the drug based on clinical and cellular markers obtained prior to treatment initiation.",10.1371/journal.pone.0209026,30540818.0,"Pohl K, Nichols DP, Taylor-Cousar JL, Saavedra MT, Strand MJ, Nick JA, Bratcher PE.

Profiling the response to lumacaftor‐ivacaftor in children with cystic between fibrosis and new insight from a French‐Italian real‐life cohort,"Introduction: Clinical trials for CFTR modulators consider mean changes of clinical status at the cohort level, and thus fail to assess the heterogeneity of the response, we aimed to study the different response profiles to lumacaftor‐ivacaftor according to age in children with cystic fibrosis (CF), Methods: A mathematical framework, including principal component analysis, data clustering, and data completion, was applied to a multicenter cohort of 112 children aged 6–18 years, treated with lumacaftor‐ivacaftor, studied parameters at baseline and 6 months included body mass index (BMI), number of days of antibiotics (ATB), Sweat test (ST), forced expiratory volume in 1 s expressed in percentage predicted (ppFEV1), forced vital capacity (ppFVC), and forced expiratory flow at 25%–75% of FVC (ppFEF25–75), Results: Change in ppFEV1 was the most significant parameter in characterizing response heterogeneity among the 12–18‐year‐old patients, patients with minimal changes in ppFEV1 were further separated by change in BMI and ATB course, in the 6–12‐year‐old children both BMI and ppFEV1 evolution were the most relevant, ST change was not associated with a clinical response, Conclusions: Change in ppFEV1, BMI, and ATB course are the most relevant outcomes to discriminate clinical response profiles in children treated with lumacaftor‐ivacaftor, prepubertal and pubertal children display different response profiles.",10.1002/ppul.26123,35996214.0,"Cornet M, Robin G, Ciciriello F, Bihouee T, Marguet C, Roy V, Lebourgeois M, Chedevergne F, Bonnel AS, Kelly M, Reix P, Lucidi V, Stoven V, Sermet-Gaudelus I.
